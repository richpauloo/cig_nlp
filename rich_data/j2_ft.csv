We employ a domain decomposition approach with Lagrange multipliers to [ ] 1 implement fault slip in a finite-element code, PyLith, for use in both quasi-static and dynamic crustal deformation applications. This integrated approach to solving both quasi-static and dynamic simulations leverages common finite-element data structures and implementations of various boundary conditions, discretization schemes, and bulk and fault rheologies. We have developed a custom preconditioner for the Lagrange multiplier portion of the system of equations that provides excellent scalability with problem size compared to conventional additive Schwarz methods. We demonstrate application of this approach using benchmarks for both quasi-static viscoelastic deformation and dynamic spontaneous rupture propagation that verify the numerical implementation in PyLith.

1 aagaard jgrb50217.pdf,I,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Introduction [ ] The earthquake cycle, from slow deformation associ- 2 ated with interseismic behavior to rapid deformation asso- ciated with earthquake rupture, spans spatial scales ranging from fractions of a meter associated with the size of con- tact asperities on faults and individual grains to thousands of kilometers associated with plate boundaries. Similarly, temporal scales range from fractions of a second associated with slip at a point during earthquake rupture to thousands of years of strain accumulation between earthquakes. The complexity of the many physical processes operating over this vast range of scales leads most researchers to focus on a narrow space-time window to isolate just one or a few processes; the limited spatial and temporal coverage of observations also often justifies this narrow focus. [ ] Researchers have recognized for some time, though, 3 that interseismic deformation and fault interactions influ- ence earthquake rupture propagation, and the dynamics of rupture propagation, in turn, affect postseismic deformation [ Igarashi et al. , 2003; Ito et al. , 2007; Chen and Lapusta , 2009; Matsuzawa et al. , 2010]. In most cases, one simplifies some portion of the process to expedite the modeling results of another portion. For example, studies of slow deforma- tion associated with interseismic and postseismic behavior 1 Earthquake Science Center, U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, California, USA. 2 Computation Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA. 3 GNS Science, Lower Hutt, New Zealand.

Solid Earth , 118 , 3059Â­3079, often approximate dynamic rupture behavior with the static coseismic slip [ Reilinger et al ., 2000; Pollitz et al ., 2001; Langbein et al ., 2006; Chlieh et al ., 2007]. Likewise, stud- ies of rapid deformation associated with earthquake rupture propagation often approximate the loading of the crust at the beginning of a rupture [ Mikumo et al. , 1998; Harris and Day , 1999; Aagaard et al. , 2001; Peyrat et al. , 2001; Oglesby and Day , 2001; Dunham and Archuleta , 2004]. Numerical seismicity models that attempt to model multiple earthquake cycles generally simplify not only the fault load- ing and rupture propagation but also the physical properties to make the calculations tractable [ Ward , 1992; Robinson and Benites , 1995; Hillers et al. , 2006; Rundle et al. , 2006; Pollitz and Schwartz , 2008; Dieterich and Richards-Dinger , 2010]. [ ] Some dynamic spontaneous rupture modeling studies 4 have attempted to examine a broader space-time window to remove simplifying assumptions and more accurately cap- ture the complex interactions over the earthquake cycle. For example, Duan and Oglesby [2005] simulated multiple earthquake cycles on a fault with a bend to capture the spa- tial variation in the stress field around the bend, which they found to have a strong role in determining whether a rupture would propagate past the bend. By spinning up the model over many earthquake cycles, they obtained a much more realistic stress field immediately prior to rupture compared with assuming a simple stress field or calculating the stress field from a static analysis. Chen and Lapusta [2009] exam- ined the behavior of small repeating earthquakes by model- ing a stable sliding region (friction increases with slip rate) surrounding an unstable sliding region (friction decreases with slip rate). They found that the aseismic slip occurring within the unstable patch between ruptures contributed a significant fraction of the long-term slip. As a result, their c(""AAGAARD ET AL.: FAULT SLIP VIA DOMAIN DECOMPOSITION"", ""simulations displayed a complex interaction between aseis-"", ""mic slip between earthquakes and coseismic slip that would"", ""not have been possible if they did not explicitly model the"", ""interseismic deformation."", ""["", ""]"", ""Kaneko et al."", ""[2011] developed more sophisticated"", ""5"", ""earthquake cycle models using spectral element simulations"", ""that permit spatial variations in physical properties that cap-"", ""ture the dynamic rupture propagation as well as the interseis-"",

1 aagaard jgrb50217.pdf,M,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Numerical Model of Fault Slip [ ] In this section, we summarize the formulation of 9 the governing equations using the finite-element method. We augment the conventional finite-element formulation for elasticity with a domain decomposition approach [ Smith et al. , 1996; Zienkiewicz et al. , 2005] to implement the fault slip. The PyLith manual [ Aagaard et al. , 2012] provides a step-by-step description of the formulation. [ ] We solve the elasticity equation including inertial 10 terms, 2 @ u Â­ f Â­ r = 0 in V , (1) 2 @ t = on S , (2) n T T u = u on S , (3) 0 u d Â­( u Â­ u )= 0 on S , (4) + Â­ f where is the displacement vector, is the mass density, is u f the body force vector, is the Cauchy stress tensor, and t is time. We specify tractions on surface S , displacements T u T 0 on surface S , and slip d on fault surface S , where the trac- u f tions and fault slip are in global coordinates. Because both T and u are vector quantities, there can be some spatial over- lap of the surfaces S and S ; however, a degree of freedom T u at any location cannot be associated with both prescribed displacements (Dirichlet) and traction (Neumann) boundary conditions simultaneously. [ ] Following a conventional finite-element formulation 11 (ignoring the fault surface for a moment), we construct the weak form by taking the dot product of the governing equation with a weighting function and setting the integral over the domain equal to zero, Ã‚ Ãƒ Z 2 @ u r + f Â­ d V =0. (5) @ 2 t V The weighting function is a piecewise differentiable vector field with = 0 on S . After some algebra and use of the u boundary conditions (equations (2) and (3)), we have Z Z Z Z 2 @ u Â­ r : d V + T d S + f d V Â­ d V =0, (6) @ 2 t V S V V T r where : is the double inner product of the gradient of the weighting function and the stress tensor. [ ] Using a domain decomposition approach, we con- 12 sider the fault surface as an interior boundary between two domains as shown in Figure 1. We assign a fault normal direction to this interior boundary and ""positive"" and ""neg- ative"" labels to the two sides of the fault, such that the fault normal is the vector from the negative side of the fault to the positive side of the fault. Slip on the fault is the displace- ment of the positive side relative to the negative side. Slip on the fault also corresponds to equal and opposite tractions on the positive ( ) and negative ( ) sides of the fault, which l l + Â­ we impose using Lagrange multipliers with l + l =0 . + Â­ c(""AAGAARD ET AL.: FAULT SLIP VIA DOMAIN DECOMPOSITION"", ""Sf+"", ""Sf-"", ""n"", ""u+,T+"", ""u-,T-"", ""Figure 1."", ""Diagram of domain decomposition approach for"", ""modeling fault slip.

(40) f c f n T in this equation corresponds to the magnitude of the shear f traction vector; the shear traction vector is resolved into the direction of the slip rate. We use the sign convention that compressive normal tractions are negative. When the fault is under compression, we prevent interpenetration, and when the fault is under tension, the fault opens ( d &gt;0 )and the n fault traction vector is zero. The fault constitutive models include static friction, linear slip-weakening [ Ida , 1972], lin- ear time-weakening [ Andrews , 2004], and Dieterich-Ruina rate-state friction with an aging law [ Dieterich , 1979]. See the PyLith manual [ Aagaard et al. , 2012] for details. Finite-Element Mesh Processing [ ] Like all finite-element engines, PyLith performs 34 operations on cells and vertices comprising the discretized domain (finite-element mesh). These operations include cal- culating cell and face integrals to evaluate weak forms, assemble local cell vectors and matrices into global vector and matrix objects, impose Dirichlet boundary conditions on the algebraic system, and solve the resulting system of non- linear algebraic equations. In PyLith, these operations are accomplished using PETSc, in particular the Sieve package for finite-element support [ Knepley and Karpeev , 2009]. [ ] The Sieve application programming interface (API) 35 for mesh representation and manipulation is based upon a direct acyclic graph representation of the covering rela- tion in a mesh, illustrated in Figure 2. For example, faces cover cells, edges cover faces, and points cover edges. By focusing on the key topological relations, the interface can be both concise and quite general. Using this generic API, PyLith is able to support 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D meshes, with simplicial, hex, and even prismatic cell shapes, while using very little dimension or shape specific code. However, in order to include faults, we include additional operations in Sieve beyond those necessary for conventional finite- element operations. [ ] In our domain decomposition approach, the finite- 36 element mesh includes the fault as an interior surface. This forces alignment of the element faces along the fault. To impose a given fault slip as in equation (4), we must rep- resent the displacement on both sides of the fault for any vertex on the fault. One option is to designate ""fault vertices"" which possess twice as many displacement DOF [ Aagaard et al. , 2001]. However, this requires storing the global variable indices by cell rather than by vertex or adding special fault metadata to the vertices, significantly increasing storage costs and/or index lookup costs. [ ] We choose another option and modify the initial 37 finite-element mesh by replacing each fault face with a zero- volume cohesive cell. Many mesh generation tools do not support specification of faces on interior surfaces. Conse- quently, we create these cohesive cells in a preprocessing step at the beginning of a simulation. We construct the set of oriented fault faces from a set of vertices marked as lying on the fault. We join these vertices into faces, consistently c(""AAGAARD ET AL.: FAULT SLIP VIA DOMAIN DECOMPOSITION"", ""(a)"", ""Interpolated triangular mesh"", ""7"", ""8"", ""9"", ""10"", ""2"", ""3"", ""4"", ""5"", ""6"", ""0"", ""1"", ""Vertices"", ""Edges"", ""Cells"", ""7"", ""8"", ""9"", ""10"", ""2"", ""3"", ""4"", ""5"", ""6"", ""0"", ""1"", ""(c)"", ""Optimized triangular mesh"", ""2"", ""3"", ""4"", ""5"", ""0"", ""1"", ""Vertices"", ""Cells"", ""2"", ""3"", ""4"", ""5"", ""0"", ""1"", ""Figure 2."", ""Direct acyclic graph representations of the covering relation for 2-D meshes with triangular"", ""and quadrilateral cells.

Quasi-static Simulations [ ] To solve the large, sparse systems of linear equations 41 arising in our quasi-static simulations, we employ precon- ditioned Krylov subspace methods [ Saad , 2003]. We create a sequence of vectors by repeatedly applying the system k matrix to the right-hand-side vector, A b , and they form a basis for a subspace, termed the Krylov space. We can efficiently find an approximate solution in this subspace. Because sparse matrix-vector multiplication is scalable via parallel processing, this is the method of choice for parallel simulation. However, for most physically relevant problems, the Krylov solver requires a preconditioner to accelerate convergence. While generic preconditioners exist [ Saad , 2003; Smith et al. , 1996], the method must often be special- ized to a particular problem. In this section, we describe a preconditioner specialized to our formulation for fault slip with Lagrange multipliers. [ ] The introduction of Lagrange multipliers to imple- 42 ment the fault slip constraints produces the saddle point problem shown in equation (24). Traditional black-box par- allel preconditioners, such as the additive Schwarz Method (ASM) [ Smith et al. , 1996], are not very effective for this type of problem and produce slow convergence. How- ever, PETSc provides tools to construct many variations of effective parallel preconditioners for saddle point problems. [ ] The field split preconditioner in PETSc [ Balay et al. , 43 2010] allows the user to define sets of unknowns which correspond to different fields in the physical problem. This scheme is flexible enough to accommodate an arbitrary num- ber of fields, mixed discretizations, fields defined over a subset of the mesh, etc. Once these fields are defined, a 3066 (d) Classify cells and Update cells with update remaining cells + - + - - + + - + - - + + - + Cell on - positive side S and a + f substantial range of preconditioners can be assembled using only PyLith options for PETSc. Table 1 shows example preconditioners and the options necessary to construct them. [ ] Another option involves using the field split pre- 44 conditioner in PETSc in combination with a custom pre- conditioner for the submatrix associated with the Lagrange multipliers. In formulating the custom preconditioner, we exploit the structure of the sparse Jacobian matrix. Our system Jacobian has the form Ã‚ Ãƒ T KL A = . (41) L 0 The Schur complement S of the submatrix K is given by Â­1 T S =Â­ LK L (42) which leads to a simple block diagonal preconditioner for A Ã‚ Ãƒ Ã‚ Ãƒ P 0 K 0 elasticity P = = . (43) Â­1 T 0 P 0Â­ LK L fault [ ] The elastic submatrix K , in the absence of boundary 45 conditions, has three translational and three rotational null modes. These are provided to the algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioner, such as the ML library [ Sala et al. , 2004] or the PETSc GAMG preconditioner, to assure an accurate coarse grid solution. AMG mimics the action of traditional geometric multigrid, but it generates coarse level operators and interpolation matrices using only the system matrix, treated as a weighted graph, rather than a separate descrip- tion of the problem geometry, such as a mesh. We split the elastic block from the fault block and also manage the Schur c(""AAGAARD ET AL.: FAULT SLIP VIA DOMAIN DECOMPOSITION"", ""a"", ""Four examples of preconditioners often used to accelerate convergence in saddle point problems.

) AAGAARD ET AL.: FAULT SLIP VIA DOMAIN DECOMPOSITION a Examination of memory system performance using three PETSc vector operations for simulations with the hexahedral meshes. The performance for the tetrahedral meshes is very similar. For ideal scaling, the number of floating point operations per second should scale linearly with the number of processes. corresponds to the operation for vector reductions, VecMDot VecAXPY corresponds to vector scaling and addition, and VecMAXPY corresponds to multiple vector scaling and addition. [ ] Figure 6 illustrates the excellent parallel perfor- 66 mance for the finite-element assembly routines (reforming the Jacobian sparse matrix and computing the residual). As discussed earlier in this section, the ASM preconditioner performance is not scalable because the number of itera- tions increases significantly with the number of processes. As shown in Figure 6, the introduction of Schur complement methods and an AMG preconditioner slows the growth con- siderably, and future work will pursue the ultimate goal of iteration counts independent of the number of processes. Code Verification Benchmarks [ ] In developing PyLith, we verify the numerical imple- 67 mentation of various features using a number of techniques. We employ unit testing to verify correct implementation of nearly all of the individual routines. Having a test for most object methods or functions isolates bugs at their ori- gin during code development and prevents new bugs from occurring as code is modified or optimized. We also rely on full-scale benchmarks to verify that the code properly solves the numerical problem. These benchmarks include quasi-static strike-slip and reverse viscoelastic simulations and various exercises in the suite of dynamic spontaneous rupture benchmarks developed by the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) and the United States Geolog- ical Survey [ Harris et al ., 2009]. The mesh generation and simulation parameter files for many of the bench- marks, including those discussed here, are available from the CIG subversion repository (http://geodynamics.org/svn/ 3071 cig/short/3D/PyLith/benchmarks/trunk/). In this section, we focus on two benchmarks that test different scientific appli- cations: quasi-static relaxation of a Maxwell viscoelastic material subjected to multiple earthquake cycles involving slip and steady creep on a vertical strike-slip fault [ Savage and Prescott , 1978] and supershear dynamic spontaneous rupture of a 60Â° dipping normal fault in a Drucker-Prager elastoplastic medium. This second benchmark corresponds to benchmark TPV13 in the SCEC suite of dynamic sponta- neous rupture benchmarks [ Harris et al ., 2011]. 6.1. Quasi-static Benchmark [ ] As a test of our quasi-static solution, we compare 68 our numerical results against the analytical solution of Savage and Prescott [1978]. This problem consists of an infinitely long strike-slip fault in an elastic layer overlying a Maxwell viscoelastic half-space. The param- eter files for this benchmark are available in the qu- asistatic/sceccrustdeform/savageprescott directory of the benchmark repository. Figure 7 illustrates the geometry of the problem with an exaggerated view of the deformation during the tenth earthquake cycle. Between earthquakes, the upper portion of the fault is locked, while the lower portion slips at the plate velocity. At regular intervals (the earthquake recurrence time), the upper portion of the fault slides such that the slip on the locked portion exactly complements the slip on the creeping portion so the cumulative slip over an earthquake cycle is uniform. [ ] This problem tests the ability of the kinematic fault 69 implementation to include steady aseismic creep and mul- tiple earthquake ruptures along with viscoelastic relaxation. a a Examination of solver performance using three of the main events com- prising the linear solve for simulations with the hexahedral meshes and 12, 24, 48, and 96 processes.

The event encompasses KSPSolve the entire linear solve. corresponds to matrix-vector multiplica- MatMult tions. and correspond to the setup and application of PCSetUp PCApply the AMG preconditioner. c(""AAGAARD ET AL.: FAULT SLIP VIA DOMAIN DECOMPOSITION"", ""Figure 6."", ""Plot of parallel scaling for the performance"", ""benchmark with the algebraic multigrid preconditioner"", ""and fault block custom preconditioner.

1 aagaard jgrb50217.pdf,C,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Conclusions [ ] PyLith provides a flexible numerical implementation 83 of fault slip using a domain decomposition approach. We have evaluated the efficiency of several preconditioners for use of this fault implementation in quasi-static simulations. We find that algebraic multigrid preconditioners for elas- ticity combined with a custom preconditioner for the fault block associated with the Lagrange multipliers accelerates the convergence of the Krylov solver with the fewest num- ber of iterations and the least sensitivity to problem size. Benchmark tests demonstrate the accuracy of our fault slip implementation in PyLith with excellent agreement to (1) an analytical solution for viscoelastic relaxation and strike-slip faulting over multiple earthquake cycles and (2) other codes for supershear dynamic spontaneous rupture on a dipping normal fault embedded in an elastoplastic domain. Conse- quently, we believe this methodology provides a promising avenue for modeling the earthquake cycle through coupling of quasi-static simulations of the interseismic and post- seismic deformation and dynamic rupture simulations of earthquake rupture propagation."

Billen Received 27 October 2011; revised 21 February 2012; accepted 1 April 2012; published 15 May 2012. The rheologic structure of subduction zones determines how the negative buoyancy [ ] 1 of sinking lithosphere (slabs) couples to the surface to cause surface deformation and plate motion. However, the rheologic structures determined using different methods are inconsistent. Analysis of the geoid and some dynamical models conclude that slabs must be weak, whereas other dynamical models and experimentally determined rheology predict that slabs are strong. Using idealized three-dimensional models of a subduction zone, we show that lateral variations in viscosity (LVVs) within a slab caused by yielding render the geoid insensitive to the viscosity structure outside of the bending region of the slab. Spectral analysis of the geoid up to harmonic degree 360 (features at wavelengths down to 110 km) shows that LVVs cause significant mode coupling with changes to the long-wavelength geoid (&gt;1000 km) caused by short-wavelength (&lt;500 km) changes to dynamic topography. Models with either a uniformly weak slab, or a strong slab with yielding, provide a good match to the observed geoid spectrum and characteristic features of the geoid over subduction zones. Therefore, observations other than the geoid are needed to constrain the strength profile of subducting slabs. Hines, J. M., and M. I.

110 hines jgrb17158.pdf,I,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Introduction [ ] The rheologic structure of the lithosphere and upper 2 mantle plays a fundamental role in determining how tectonic plates form [ Braun et al. , 2000], move across the surface of the planet [ Richards et al. , 2001], and are eventually sub- ducted [ Gurnis and Hager , 1988]. Experimental constraints on the viscous behavior of olivine [ Goetze , 1978; Karato et al. ,1986; Hirth and Kohlstedt , 2003; Karato et al. , 2008], and other minerals [ Bystricky and Mackwell , 2001; Mierdel et al. , 2007] and phases [ Chen et al. , 1998; Yamazaki et al. , 2005; Shimojuku et al. , 2009], demonstrate that large varia- tions in viscosity are expected in the upper mantle due to the strong temperature, stress, and grain-size dependence of the viscous flow laws [ Karato and Wu , 1993; Hirth and Kohlstedt , 2003]. In addition, the broad range of tempera- ture, pressure, and stress conditions in subduction zones leads to variations in the effective strength along the length of the slab due to changes in the dominant mode of deforma- tion from the surface into the mantle, for example, changing from elastic deformation to plastic yielding to viscous flow [ Goetze and Evans , 1979; Weidner et al. , 2001; Hirth , 2003]. 1 Department of Geology, University of California, Davis, California, USA. Corresponding author: M. I. Billen, Department of Geology, University of California, 1 Shields Ave., Davis, CA 95616, USA. (mibillen@ucdavis.edu) Copyright 2012 by the American Geophysical Union. 0148-0227/12/2011JB008978 B05410 doi:10.1029/2011JB008978 , 2012 [ ] Because of the various deformational processes, phys- 3 ical conditions, and uncertainties related to compositional effects and rates of deformation, other approaches have been used to independently determine the viscosity structure of the upper mantle in subduction zones or to test the applicability of experimental rheology. These other approaches include analysis of the geoid, both globally and regionally, and instantaneous and time-dependent dynamical models of sub- duction. However, a review of these two types of studies reveals an inconsistency between the viscosity structures inferred from geoid studies, which require weak slabs, and dynamical models, which require stiffer slabs. [ ] We hypothesize that the inconsistency among different 4 constraints on the viscosity structure in subduction zones is the result of the insensitivity of the geoid (and other surface observations) to lithosphere and slab strength outside of the bending region of the slab, which has a lower effective vis- cosity due to plastic yielding. We present a three-dimensional (3-D) model of an idealized subduction zone in order to test the sensitivity of the geoid to differences in viscosity structure for models with layered, temperature- and stress-dependent viscosity, both with and without the effects of plastic yield- ing. We find that yielding in the bending region of the slab renders the geoid insensitive to the deeper viscosity structure, thus possibly reconciling the different methods for deter- mining subduction zone rheologic structure.

[ ] While most geoid studies conclude that slabs are 18 weak, these studies have not allowed for variations in the viscosity of the slab along its length due to yielding or grain- size dependence as is found in dynamical models using experimentally derived rheology. Yielding of the slab can directly affect coupling of the slab buoyancy to the surface, including deformation of the forebulge, trench depth, and coupling to the overriding plate, and thus directly affect the geoid through changes in the dynamic topography at a range of wavelengths. Indeed, recent 2-D models including local- ized weakening of the bending region of the subducting plate and plate boundary suggest that the geoid may not be able to provide a unique constraint on the viscosity (and chemical) structure of the mantle [ Krien and Fleitout , 2008]."
110 hines jgrb17158.pdf,M,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Methods [ ] To determine the sensitivity of the geoid to the 19 rheology of an idealized subduction zone, we require a high- resolution 3-D model that can resolve large gradients in viscosity and allows for both poloidal and toroidal flow. Realistic flow is central to the results because the dynamic topography, and therefore the geoid, depend on the velocity and stress at the surface. 3.1. Numerical Methods [ ] We use the regional version of the finite element code 20 CitcomS [ Tan et al. , 2006; Zhong et al. , 2000] to model ' instantaneous incompressible Stokes flow with free-slip boundary conditions.

The model domain extends 65 to 100 in longi-   tude ( f ), 95 to 130 in colatitude ( q ), and from the surface to the core-mantle boundary. The subduction zone is placed at the center of the domain (Figure 1a).

[ ] Small-scale mass anomalies, such as the trench 33 dynamic topography, contribute less to the total geoid than do larger-scale anomalies, such as the slab buoyancy. We use the energy density spectrum of the modeled geoid to analyze how changes in the viscosity structure affect the geoid over different wavelength ranges, and in particular to identify the low-power short-wavelength response to varying rheology. The energy density, S , at degree l is given by l  X Ã€Ã<81> Ã€Ã<81> l 3 2 p R 2 2 Â¼ Ã¾ ; Ã° Ãž 0 m m S c s 11 l l l l Â¼ m 0 m m where c and s are the spherical harmonic cosine and sine l l coefficients for the geoid [ Kaula , 1967]. We also present trench-perpendicular profiles of model dynamic topography and the geoid to illustrate how specific features respond to changes in the viscosity structure and contribute to the geoid spectrum. [ ] The energy density spectrum for the observed geoid 34 exhibits power law decay with decreasing wavelength (Figure 2a). One goal of the models presented is to identify which viscosity structures reproduce this power law depen- dence of the geoid on wavelength over a large range of wavelengths (110 to 8000 km). Trench-perpendicular pro- files across representative subduction zones also illustrate characteristic features of the geoid (Figure 2b): A long $ wavelength geoid high of less than 100 m [ Lemoine et al. , 1998] with an asymmetric, higher geoid amplitude above the overriding plate (and subducted slab), and a small-amplitude, narrow geoid low over the trench [ King , 2002]. Models will also be evaluated as to how well these characteristic features of the observed geoid are predicted."
110 hines jgrb17158.pdf,RD,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Results [ ] We begin by presenting a reference model, which 35 includes the best estimate of olivine rheology from laboratory experiments, including the effects of plastic yielding, and is consistent with the viscosity structure used in recent dynamical models of subduction [e.g., Billen and Hirth , z 2007; CÃ­ kovÃ¡ et al. , 2002; Jadamec and Billen , 2010]. The reference model is compared to models with simpler vis- cosity structures (layered viscosity, temperature-dependent, and composite viscosity without yielding). Because the model uses an idealized subduction zone structure, we use the reference model as a type of synthetic observation, for which all the buoyancy sources are perfectly known. This approach eliminates one of the major uncertainties in mod- eling the geoid and allows us to focus on testing if the geoid is sensitive to the lateral variations in viscosity. Although we cannot directly compare model results to a specific sub- duction zone, we do compare to characteristic features found in the profiles of geoid and dynamic topography, and to the observed geoid spectrum, as discussed above. A total of 21 models were run to fully explore the effects illustrated by the 14 models presented (Table 3). 4.1.

Profiles of cumulative ( l =1to l ) and finite max ( l = l to l ) geoid expansions for model C3CRwz (same min max as reference model, but without yielding). Comparison to the reference model (Figure 5) illustrates how yielding affects the wavelength and amplitude of the contributions to the geoid, e.g., broad trench low with larger amplitudes for this model without yielding. between geoid profiles and spectra are minimal and nonunique considering the trade-off between yield strength and lower mantle strength. These results show that when the slab yields, the geoid becomes insensitive to the deeper viscosity structure. Discussion [ ] Using the geoid as a constraint on mantle viscosity 60 structure has always been limited by incomplete information about the buoyancy forces in the mantle and the difficulty in observing dynamic topography. In using a synthetic sub- duction zone to test the sensitivity of the geoid (and dynamic topography) to changes in the viscosity structure, we have avoided these uncertainties. Our results confirm that mode- coupling induced by LVV does indeed affect the magnitude of the geoid anomalies over subduction zones, consistent with prior studies [ Hager and Clayton , 1989; Ravine and Morgan , 1993; Ghosh et al. , 2010]. However, are these dif- ferences large enough to distinguish between competing viscosity structures using the observed geoid? [ ] Based on the model results we find that the geoid is 61 insufficient to differentiate between a layered viscosity struc- ture or a Newtonian-rheology slab with limited maximum 23 viscosity (10 Pa-s) (as in King and Hager [1994]), or a 24 higher-viscosity non-Newtonian rheology slab (10 Pa-s) with yielding (all with a plate boundary weak zone). For the layered or Newtonian-only viscosity models, not only are the amplitude and geometry of the geoid signal very similar, but so are the geoid spectra. Similar to previous studies, we find that uniformly strong slabs depress the geoid and make it 12 of 15 B05410 notably negative if the slab is more than 3 orders of magnitude stronger than the ambient mantle (as in Yoshida and Nakakuki [2009]), because strong slabs guide stress to the trench [ Moresi and Gurnis , 1996]. However, prior models that use moder- -- ately strong slabs cases in which the slab is stronger than the mantle but weaker than the lithosphere [e.g., Moresi and Gurnis , 1996; Zhong and Davies ,1999; Billen et al. , 2003; -- Tosi et al. , 2009] produce positive geoid anomalies because the moderately strong slabs do not fully couple to the sub- ducting lithosphere at the surface. [ ] For models with yielding slabs, the most obvious dif- 62 ference in the profiles is the signal on the overriding plate, which for the observed geoid is difficult to deconvolve from shallow density anomalies associated with the island arc. Although the spectra for models with effective viscosity are different, the main sensitivity of the geoid in the models is to the plate boundary weak zone, consistent with previous studies [ Zhong and Davies ,1999; Yoshida and Nakakuki , 2009; Ghosh et al. , 2010], and yielding at shallow depth. Similar to the effects of imposed weakening in prior models [e.g., Krien and Fleitout , 2008], we find that yielding largely desensitizes the geoid to other changes to the deeper viscosity structure. [ ] These results suggest that (1) the geoid can not be used 63 to easily differentiate between weaker slabs with Newtonian rheology and stronger slabs with non-Newtonian rheology and yielding, and (2) if yielding of the slab occurs in the real Earth, the geoid may be insensitive to the deeper structure of the subduction zone. In particular, the process of yielding within the slab will always decrease the transmission of deeper stresses to the surface, therefore rendering the geoid insensi- tive to the strength of the slab outside the yielding region. [ ] The geoid modeling results also help to explain why 64 some dynamical models of subduction and long-wavelength analysis of the geoid have concluded that slabs are weak, despite experimental constraints on rheology that predict slabs should be strong (as discussed in section 1). If the ref- erence model with an experimentally constrained rheology is an accurate representation of the viscosity structure of the Earth, then the observations used to test many dynamical models (plate motions, dynamic topography, geoid) are pri- marily sensitive to the region of the slab weakened by yielding. This suggest that using observations of the geom- etry of the slabs together with surface kinematics are neces- sary to better constrain the deeper viscosity structure in subduction zones."
110 hines jgrb17158.pdf,C,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Conclusions [ ] Using an idealized 3-D model of a subduction zone we 65 have investigated the sensitivity of the geoid to changes in the viscosity structure including the effects of a plate boundary weak zone, temperature-dependent viscosity, composite vis- cosity, and plastic yielding. By analyzing the profiles of dynamic topography and geoid, as well as the spectral response of the geoid, we have shown how different LVVs affect mode coupling and change the character of the geoid. [ ] We find that the plate boundary weak zone shifts sub- 66 duction zone dynamic topography to shorter wavelengths, which increases the sensitivity of the geoid to lithospheric strength at all wavelengths, independent of slab strength. In particular, layered viscosity models without this weak plate boundary exhibit a lack of power in the geoid at short HINES AND BILLEN: GEOID SENSITIVITY TO SUBDUCTION RHEOLOGY B05410  24 wavelengths. Uniformly strong slabs ( 10 Pa-s) behave as stress guides and amplify the dynamic topography, which leads to increased power in the geoid spectrum at various wavelength ranges, depending on the coupling of the slab to the surface. However, the longest-wavelength geoid can not be used alone to infer relative strengths in subduction zones, because longest-wavelength geoid predictions can agree with observation without matching characteristic forebulge-trench topography. [ ] Adding plastic yielding into the models decreases the 67 amplitude of the dynamic topography and geoid by reducing the coupling between the sinking slab and the surface. The geoid and dynamic topography are largely similar for uni- 23 24 form-viscosity slabs (10 Pa-s) and a strong slab (10 Pa-s) with yielding. Therefore, when plastic yielding is included in models, the geoid is mostly sensitive to the viscosity in the bending region of the slab and becomes insensitive to the deeper viscosity structure, including the slab and lower mantle viscosity.

122 jadamec jgrb16995.pdf,A,Journal of Geophysical Research,"The role of rheology and slab shape on rapid mantle flow: Three-dimensional numerical models of the Alaska slab edge 1,2 1 M. A. Jadamec and M. I. Billen Received 31 May 2011; revised 6 December 2011; accepted 8 December 2011; published 9 February 2012. Away from subduction zones, the surface motion of oceanic plates is well [ ] 1 correlated with mantle flow direction, as inferred from seismic anisotropy. However, this correlation breaks down near subduction zones, where shear wave splitting studies suggest the mantle flow direction is spatially variable and commonly non-parallel to plate motions. This implies local decoupling of mantle flow from surface plate motions, yet the magnitude of this decoupling is poorly constrained. We use 3D numerical models of the eastern Alaska subduction-transform plate boundary system to further explore this decoupling, in terms of both direction and magnitude. Specifically, we investigate the role of the slab geometry and rheology on the mantle flow velocity at a slab edge. The subducting plate geometry is based on Wadati-Benioff zone seismicity and tomography, and the 3D thermal structure for both the subducting and overriding plates, is constrained by geologic and geophysical observations. In models using the composite viscosity, a laterally variable mantle viscosity emerges as a consequence of the lateral variations in the mantle flow and strain rate. Spatially variable mantle velocity magnitudes are predicted, with localized fast velocities (greater than 80 cm/yr) close to the slab where the negative buoyancy of the slab drives the flow. The same models produce surface plate motions of less than 10 cm/yr, comparable to observed plate motions. These results show a power law rheology, i.e., one that includes the effects of the dislocation creep deformation mechanism, can explain both observations of seismic anisotropy and decoupling of mantle flow from surface motion.

122 jadamec jgrb16995.pdf,I,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Introduction [ ] Plate boundaries are inherently three-dimensional (3D) 2 tectonic features with variations in geometry and physical properties along their length [ Jarrard , 1986; Gudmundsson and Sambridge , 1998; Bird , 2003; Lallemand et al. , 2005; Sdrolias and Muller , 2006; Syracuse and Abers , 2006; Rychert et al. , 2008]. For example, subduction zones have significant changes in slab dip along strike, including flat slab segments, as in the eastern Alaska subduction zone, the Peru-Chile Trench, the Cascadia subduction zone, and the southwestern Japan Trench [ Gudmundsson and Sambridge , 1998; Gutscher et al. , 2000; Ratchkovski and Hansen , 2002; Lallemand et al. , 2005; Syracuse and Abers , 2006; Tassara et al. , 2006]. In addition, many plate boundaries are not simply end-member subduction zones, transform faults, or spreading centers in isolation, but rather are hybrid sys- tems. For example, plate boundary corners with slab edges 1 Geology Department, University of California, Davis, California, USA. 2 School of Mathematical Sciences and School of Geosciences, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.

Subduction-transform intersections also occur in non-corner geometries, as in the termination of the Ker- madec Trench against the Alpine fault in New Zealand and the north and south terminations of the Cascadian subduc- tion zone [ Gudmundsson and Sambridge , 1998; Bird , 2003]. The three-dimensionality in both surface and subsurface structure can influence the relative motion of the mantle with respect to the surface plates. Thus, in many cases a two- dimensional (2D) approach to studying plate boundary pro- cesses can miss critical aspects of the dynamics resulting purely from the geometry. [ ] Away from subduction zones, the surface motion of 3 oceanic plates is well correlated with mantle flow direction, as inferred from seismic anisotropy [ Kreemer , 2009; Conrad et al. , 2007; Becker et al. , 2003]. However, observations of seismic anisotropy from numerous subduction zones display seismic fast directions that are non-parallel to plate motions, e.g., the Peru-Chile, Kamchatka, Tonga, Marianas, South 1of 20 c(""JADAMEC AND BILLEN: RHEOLOGY, SLAB SHAPE, RAPID MANTLE FLOW"", ""B02304"", ""Sandwich, Cascadia, Costa Rica-Nicaragua, and eastern"", ""Alaska subduction zones ["", ""Russo and Silver"", "", 1994;"", ""Peyton"", ""et al."", "", 2001;"", ""Smith et al."", "", 2001;"", ""Pozgay et al."", "", 2007;"", ""Muller"", ""et al."", "", 2008;"", ""Zandt and Humphreys"", "", 2008;"", ""Long and Silver"", "","", ""2008;"", ""Abt et al."", "", 2009;"", ""Christensen and Abers"", "", 2010].

In addition, we discuss implications specific to Alaskan tectonics. The approach taken for models presented in this paper, as well as those of Jadamec and Billen [2010], differs from that in previous 3D numerical models of subduction in that previous models [ Moresi and Gurnis , 1996; Zhong and Gurnis , 1996; Billen et al. , 2003; Billen and Gurnis , 2003; Piromallo et al. , 2006; Stegman et al. , 2006; Schellart et al. , 2007; Kneller and van Keken , 2007; Giuseppe et al. , 2008; Kneller and van Keken , 2008] either use a simplified plate geometry, prescribe a velocity boundary condition to the subducting plate, do not include an overriding plate, or use a Newtonian rheology in the mantle. Alaskan Subduction-Transform Boundary [ ] The Aleutian-Alaska subduction zone accommodates 7 convergence between the northernmost Pacific plate and the Alaskan part of the North American plate (Figure 1). The subduction zone length is greater than 3000 km, and along this length the sense of curvature changes from convex to the south in the central Aleutians to convex to the north in south central Alaska [ Page et al. , 1989; Gudmundsson and Sambridge , 1998; Ratchkovski and Hansen , 2002; Bird , 2003]. Offshore south central Alaska, the observed Pacific plate motion with respect to North America is N16Â°W at 5.2 cm/yr [ DeMets and Dixon , 1999]. The easternmost part of the subduction zone forms a plate boundary corner where the Aleutian trench terminates against the northwest trend- ing Fairweather-Queen Charlotte transform fault (Figure 1) [ Bird , 2003]. In this plate boundary corner, the dip of the subducting plate shallows to form a flat slab [ Ratchkovski and Hansen , 2002], and the Yakutat block, a buoyant oceanic plateau, is subducting beneath the North American plate [ Bruns , 1985; Pavlis et al. , 2004; Ferris et al. , 2003] (Figure 1). [ ] East of approximately 212Â° longitude, where the sub- 8 duction zone approaches the transform boundary, there is an abrupt decrease in seismicity at depths greater than 25 km (Figure 1). Despite the decrease in seismicity, several seis- mic studies suggest there is a steeply dipping slab, the Wrangell slab, in this region of the plate boundary corner beneath the active adakitic Wrangell Volcanoes (Figures 1 and 2) [ Stephens et al. , 1984; Skulski et al. ,1991; Preece and Hart , 2004]. There is debate over the geometry of the Wrangell slab as well as its continuity with the main Aleu- tian slab to the west [ Perez and Jacob , 1980; Stephens et al. , 1984; Page et al. , 1989; Zhao et al. , 1995; Ratchkovski and Hansen , 2002; Eberhart-Phillips et al. , 2006; Fuis et al. , 2008]. Therefore, we construct two slab geometries, one with and one without the Wrangell slab, to test the influence of the slab geometry on the mantle flow in this plate boundary corner (Figure 1)."

Using the interactive 3D virtual reality facility enabled the massive amounts of data (several Gigabytes per model run) to be conceptualized and allowed for identifica- tion of key areas to target for more quantitive analysis with MATLAB or other tools like GMT. To preserve the choices and features that were explored and identified, numerous sessions were recorded with a playback feature making the sessions portable to a movie format. 3D model results were also visualized with the desktop version of 3DVisualizer."
122 jadamec jgrb16995.pdf,RD,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Results [ ] We present results based on eighteen 3D models in 37 which we varied the subducting plate geometry, upper mantle viscosity structure (Newtonian versus composite viscosity), yield stress, plate boundary coupling, and the overriding plate lithospheric thickness (Table 1). When describing the models, we refer to the viscosity structure as either Newtonian or composite. Let the reader note that, as indicated in section 3, both of these formulations include a depth-dependent yield stress. 10 of 20 B02304 with 115 with Newtonian viscosity. Vertical velocity along 4.1. 3D Mantle Flow and Subducting Plate Geometry [ ] The incorporation of realistic slab geometries into 3D 38 models of subduction leads to a complex pattern of poloidal and toroidal flow in the mantle, with the spatial positions of the mantle flow components sensitive to the slab geometry. Â­ Figures 4a 4f illustrate this complex flow field for three representative models: Model A1c with slab and the E 325 composite rheology (Figures 4a and 4d), Model B1c with slab and the composite rheology (Figures 4b and 4e), E 115 and Model B1n with slab and the Newtonian rheology E 115 (Figures 4c and 4f). These three models use a depth depen- dent yield stress of 500 MPa and a weak zone viscosity of 20 10 Pa s (Table 1). Â­ Â­ [ ] Figures 4a 4c and Figures 5a 5c show counter- 39 clockwise toroidal flow in the mantle, where the slab edge provides an opening for the return flow from beneath the slab, around the slab edge, and into the mantle wedge. Here, the low viscosity mantle flows around the higher viscosity slab. In models with slab , the toroidal flow is centered E 325 around 222Â° longitude (Figures 4a and 5a), whereas, in models with slab , the toroidal flow is centered at E 115 approximately 212Â° longitude (Figures 4b, 4c, 5b, and 5c). This occurs because in models with the slab , the depth E 115 of the slab east of 212Â° is comparable to the depth of the base of the overriding lithosphere, and thus is too short to induce toroidal flow in the mantle east of 212Â° (Figures 1b, 2h, and 4b). Thus, one of the effects of slab versus E 115 slab is to shift the locus of the toroidal cell approximately E 325 c(""10Â° westward so that it is focused around the most northern"", ""part of the slab.

In other words, the same 3D geodynamic models of the Alaska subduction-transform system that predict velocity magnitudes of greater than 80 cm/yr in the mantle close to the subduction zone, also predict surface plate velocities comparable to observed plate motions. Discussion [ ] The results from the 3D models of the Alaska sub- 63 duction-transform system demonstrate the ranges in mantle velocities that can be produced assuming an experimentally determined flow law for olivine and a realistic slab geometry and density structure. The results show larger velocity ran- ges as well as sharper velocity gradients in models using the composite viscosity formulation. The maximum mantle velocity predicted by the 3D models of the Alaska subduc- tion-transform system ranges from less than 10 cm/yr in the Newtonian models to over 80 cm/yr in the composite vis- cosity models. The maximum velocity that occurs in the mantle wedge, around the slab edge, and underneath the slab depends on several factors: the (1) slab density anomaly, i.e., the driving force; (2) slab strength, which depends in part on the yield strength; (3) mantle viscosity; (4) plate boundary coupling, i.e., viscosity along the plate interface; and (5) the proximity of the mantle to the slab edge. 5.1. Spatially Variable Slab and Mantle Viscosity [ ] The consequence of using an experimentally derived 64 Newtonian and composite viscosity formulation in the 3D numerical models of the Alaska subduction-transform sys- tem is that the slab strength depends on the thermal structure, and on the strain rate for the composite viscosity formulation [ Billen and Hirth , 2007; Jadamec and Billen , 2010]. Therefore, a strong slab core emerges from the rheological flow law [ Jadamec and Billen , 2010]. The depth dependent yield stress places a limit on the maximum strength of the slab determined from the experimentally derived flow law. [ ] In models with the composite rheology, the slab hinge 65 area becomes locally weakened, with viscosities reduced 24 22 from 10 Pa s to on the order of 10 Pa s (Figures 4g and 4h). This gives a viscosity difference of three to four orders of magnitude between the slab hinge and the mantle sur- rounding the slab, and of up to six orders of magnitude between the stronger parts of the slab and the weakest part of the mantle wedge (Figures 4g and 4h). In models using the Newtonian viscosity, the slab is not weakened in the slab 24 hinge and maintains a viscosity on the order of 10 Pa s in the core, with a viscosity difference between the slab and mantle on the order of four orders of magnitude (Figure 4i). The viscosity ratios in our models are in the upper range of those suggested from previous 2D and 3D models of sub- duction, where the viscosity contrasts between the slab and the mantle range from two to six orders of magnitude [ Piromallo et al. , 2006; Stegman et al. , 2006; Royden and Husson , 2006; Billen and Hirth , 2007; Schellart et al. , 2007; Kneller and van Keken , 2008; Schellart , 2008; Giuseppe et al. , 2008; Jadamec and Billen , 2010; Ribe , 2010]. c(""["", ""66"", ""] The models of the Alaska subduction-transform sub-"", ""duction zone that use the composite viscosity formulation"", ""exhibit a localized lower viscosity in the mantle surrounding"", ""the slab, and therefore locally reduced viscous support of the"", ""slab.

The lack of a slab continuous to the transition zone beneath south central Alaska could result from previous detachment of the deeper part of the subducted plate due to the subduction of the Yakutat terrane or due to a weakness in the subducting plate at depth because of sub- duction of the failed Kula-Farallon spreading center [ Madsen et al. , 2006; Qi et al. , 2007]. Investigating the potential detachment of a slab with depth over the course of the sub- duction history of southern Alaska is beyond the scope of this paper, but would be interesting to investigate using future time-dependent modeling studies and would likely be more tractable with future codes using adaptive mesh refinement [e.g., Stadler et al. , 2010]. [ ] The seismicity, seismic tomography, and the agree- 82 ment between the models using slab and the seismic E 115 anisotropy from the northern mantle wedge, suggest slab E 115 is representative of the actual slab shape beneath mainland Alaska, and that slab is not (Table 4 and Jadamec and E 325 Billen [2010]). The numerical models show that the rela- tive depth of the slab tip and base of the overriding litho- sphere influences whether there will be flow induced in the mantle. Thus, for models using slab , although this slab E 115 shape has two slab edges, one at approximately 212Â° lon- gitude (beneath south central Alaska) and the other at 223Â° longitude (near the northern end of the Queen Charlotte-Fairweather fault), only the deeper slab edge at 212Â° induces toroidal flow. The lack of induced flow near the northern end of the Queen Charlotte-Fairweather fault implies that there is little strain induced in the mantle wedge here and therefore we would not expect a well developed LPO in the mantle wedge in the vicinity of the easternmost Wrangell slab. If, however, the actual slab shape were two- tiered as in slab but with the slab beneath the Wrangells E 115 extending to 175 km, rather than to 115 km, we would expect the tiered shape to produce two regions of toroidal flow in the mantle, one centered at 212Â° longitude and the second centered farther to the east at 223Â° longitude. In this case, one would expect a well developed LPO, and thus organized pattern in the seismic anisotropy, in the mantle wedge near both 212Â° and 223Â° longitude. Additional seis- mic anisotropy measurements near the northern end of the Queen Charlotte-Fairweather fault would be useful to better constrain the depth of the shorter slab segment beneath the Wrangell mountains."
122 jadamec jgrb16995.pdf,C,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Conclusions [ ] We have constructed 3D instantaneous regional 83 models of the eastern Alaska subduction-transform plate boundary system to investigate the role of slab geometry and rheology on the decoupling of mantle flow from surface plate motion, in terms of both direction and magnitude, at subduction zones. The 3D models use a subducting plate geometry based on Wadati-Benioff zone seismicity and seismic tomography and a 3D thermal structure for both the subducting and overriding plates, constrained by geologic and geophysical observations. The models test the effect of a Netwonian viscosity and a composite viscosity, which includes both the diffusion and dislocation creep JADAMEC AND BILLEN: RHEOLOGY, SLAB SHAPE, RAPID MANTLE FLOW B02304 mechanisms (i.e., Newtonian and non-Newtonian viscosity). The models in this paper differ from previous 3D numerical models of subduction in that previous models either use a simplified plate geometry, prescribe a velocity boundary condition to the subducting plate, do not include an over- riding plate, or use a Newtonian rheology in the mantle. However, our models are limited in that they are instanta- neous, examining the spatial distribution of the flow rather than the time-dependent evolution. [ ] Models using the composite viscosity formulation 84 have higher strain rates and lower mantle viscosities than models using the Newtonian viscosity. In models using the composite viscosity, a laterally variable mantle viscosity emerges as a consequence of the lateral variations in the mantle flow and strain rate. Spatially variable mantle velocity magnitudes are predicted, with localized fast velocities (greater than 80 cm/yr) close to the slab where the negative buoyancy of the slab drives the flow. The same models pro- duce surface plate motions of less than 10 cm/yr, comparable to observed plate motions. We expect that it is short slabs undergoing slab steepening, not supported by the higher viscosity mantle below the transition zone, that are more likely to induce the localized rapid mantle flow. These results show that a power law rheology, i.e., one that includes the effects of the dislocation creep deformation mechanism, can explain both observations of seismic anisotropy and the decoupling of mantle flow from surface motion. [ ] The incorporation of realistic slab geometries into 3D 85 models of subduction leads to a complex pattern of poloidal and toroidal flow in the mantle, with the spatial positions of the mantle flow components sensitive to the slab geometry. We conclude that slab is representative of the actual slab E 115 shape beneath south central Alaska. The vertical motion of mantle material near slab edges may play a role in forming melts from both decompression melting and melting of the slab edge (i.e., adakites), as this part of the subduction zone is continuously exposed to upward advected warm mantle material. The Wrangell volcanics may be due in part to the upwelling associated with the deeper edge of slab . E 115 [ ] Acknowledgments. We thank C. Matyska, W. P.

The delay is accompanied by strong amplitude decay of SVdiff with distance. This relationship resembles the effect of anelasticity. In a model with a low of SVdiff can be very different from SHdiff, and this difference can be mistaken for a  delay of SHdiff relative to SVdiff. In a laterally heterogeneous isotropic D also be delayed because, unlike SHdiff, SVdiff has strong amplitude decay along fast paths. Its traveltime is thus dominated by slow propagation paths and tends to be positively  biased. For D models with an S velocity difference of 3% between two hemispheres, there  are regions where SHdiff arrives up to 15 s earlier than the first clearly visible SVdiff. This is observed in a corridor several hundred kilometers wide. If these effects are  misinterpreted in terms of D anisotropy in actual seismic data, estimates of anisotropy are biased and may contribute to the idea of seismic anisotropy being different in high    low S velocity regions of D .

142 kom jgrb16319.pdf,I,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Introduction   [ ] The D layer atop the core mantle boundary is a 2 complex region of the Earth and is a focus of numerous seismic studies (for a review see, e.g., Wysession et al.   [1998]). Large scale (more than 1000 km) features in D are nearly the same in different tomographic models [e.g., Ritsema , 2005]. On a global scale the lowermost mantle   "" "" exhibits two large low S velocity regions or superplumes, one beneath the central Pacific and the other beneath the southern Atlantic and Africa. Some borders of the African superplume are sharp [ Ni et al. , 2002]. Some large Meso-  zoic Cenozoic igneous provinces and hot spots are thought to be directly related to the superplumes [e.g., Williams et al. , 1998; Thorne et al. , 2004], and there is a consensus on the   correspondence between large scale high velocity regions   in D and ancient subduction zones [e.g., Dziewo ski et al. ,  1977; Hager et al. , 1985]. The range of large scale lateral S  velocity variations in D is around Â±3% [e.g., Romanowicz ,  1 UMR 5212 and INRIA Magique 3D, UniversitÃ© de Pau et des Pays de ' l Adour, CNRS, Pau, France. 2 Institut Universitaire de France, Paris, France. 3 Institute of Physics of the Earth, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia. 4 Dynamique Terrestre et PlanÃ©taire, UMR 5562, UniversitÃ© Paul  Sabatier, CNRS, Observatoire Midi PyrÃ©nÃ©es, Toulouse, France.

Geophys. Res. ,   2008]. Beyond the large scale features in D there are  numerous indications of smaller scale heterogeneities [e.g., Luo et al. , 2001; Garcia et al. , 2004; Krueger et al. , 1995], but the details of these features are less well constrained and often controversial [see, e.g., Stutzmann et al. , 2000].  [ ]D is not only laterally heterogeneous but also aniso- 3 tropic, at least in some areas [e.g., Panning and Romanowicz ,  2004]. The usually assumed form of anisotropy in D is hexagonal with a vertical symmetry axis (vertical transverse isotropy or VTI). Transverse isotropy leads to a difference in  travel times of the vertically and horizontally polarized S waves (SV and SH, respectively). This difference is observed  in the S waves reflected from the core mantle boundary (the ScS seismic phase) [e.g., Russell et al. , 1999; Rokosky et al. , 2004; Wookey et al. , 2005] and diffracted at this boundary (Sdiff) [e.g., Lay and Young , 1991; Ritsema et al. , 1998; Fouch et al. , 2001; Thomas and Kendall , 2002; Panning and Romanowicz , 2004]. ScS arrives to the receiver at a time that is close to the arrival time of S and of some other seismic phases related to seismic boundaries in the lowermost mantle. Interpretations of the resulting interference pattern in  terms of D anisotropy can therefore be problematic. Wave  paths of Sdiff in the D layer can be much longer than those of ScS, which implies a larger sensitivity to the properties of  D . This is an advantage but also raises specific issues that are discussed in the present study. The nature and origin of  anisotropy in D remained unclear until it was found that at  the pressures and temperatures in D the silicate perovskite 1of 13 c(""B07312"", ""KOMATITSCH ET AL.: SHDIFF"", ""Figure 1."", ""Copy of Figure 1c of"", ""Moore et al."", ""[2004] showing"", """", ""SVdiff"", ""SHdiff splitting times.

142 kom jgrb16319.pdf,M,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Modeling SHdiff and SVdiff [ ] To investigate the propagation of SVdiff and SHdiff in 6    a laterally heterogeneous D layer, we need to turn to a full waveform numerical modeling technique. To reach periods of a few seconds, we need a method that is both precise and able to handle very large numerical meshes of the Earth. In  the last decade, the spectral element method (SEM) has proven to be well adapted to our problem: it has been suc- cessfully applied to regional seismology [see, e.g., Liu et al. , 2004] the full 3D Earth [see, e.g., Komatitsch and Tromp , 2002a, 2002b; Chaljub and Valette , 2004; Chaljub et al. , 2007] and has been used at very high resolution on large parallel machines with thousands of processors [see, e.g., Komatitsch et al. , 2003, 2008; Tsuboi et al. , 2003]. More-  over, it can accurately handle fluid solid interfaces such as the CMB [see, e.g., Komatitsch et al. , 2000; Komatitsch and Tromp , 2002a]. [ ] The largest calculations that we can currently perform 7 for parametric studies (comparing different models) can reach a minimum period of typically 5 seconds [ Komatitsch et al. , 2003, 2008; Tsuboi et al. , 2003] for a fully 3D elastic Earth. In this study we want our simulations to be accurate down to at least the same period (5 seconds). We therefore mesh the full Earth using 639,995,904 hexahedral spectral elements and we use polynomial basis functions of degree 4 to dis- cretize the wave field inside each spectral element. This corresponds to approximately 42.2 billion grid points in the mesh and 115.1 billion degrees of freedom to compute at each iteration of the time loop of the SEM algorithm. We run the calculations in parallel on 6144 processor cores by dividing the mesh into 6144 slices having the same number of mesh elements and using message passing between  computers based on the Message Passing Interface (MPI) [see, e.g., Gropp et al. , 1994; Komatitsch and Tromp , 2002a; Komatitsch et al. , 2003, 2008] to exchange information between processor cores that handle mesh slices that are in contact by a common face or edge. The simulations require 0.9 gigabyte of memory per processor, i.e., a total of 5.5 terabytes. We use our SPECFEM3D software package, which is freely available from www.geodynamics.org. To simulate 33 minutes of seismograms we run the SEM for 47,200 time steps of a duration of 42 milliseconds each, which requires approximately 22 hours of elapsed time on the 6144 processor cores used in parallel. [ ] We can see that reaching such very high resolution is 8 expensive from a numerical point of view. Viscoelasticity (anelastic attenuation) can be modeled using the SEM [see, e.g., Komatitsch and Tromp , 2002a], but the numerical cost in terms of both memory usage and CPU time increases by a  factor of 1.5. We therefore do not include it in our simu- lations. Moreover, the effects of anelastic attenuation are predictable: they are similar for SVdiff and SHdiff and do not affect the difference in travel times or spectra of SVdiff and SHdiff. In all the calculations in this article we use the IASP91 model [ Kennett and Engdahl , 1991] with smoothed  transition zone discontinuities and the crust removed (see B07312 KOMATITSCH ET AL.: SHDIFF 1 auxiliary material). Removing the crust in our models and   smoothing the 410 km and 660 km discontinuities is a necessary step because, although these boundaries do not affect the propagation of Sdiff, they generate reverberations that, in the absence of anelastic attenuation, may contaminate the records of Sdiff. Moreover, accurate sampling of low velocities in the crust is numerically costly. Since density is  not specified in IASP91 we take it from PREM [ Dziewo ski and Anderson , 1981]. [ ] The source is located at the surface of the Earth at 9 0Â° latitude and longitude. It is a Centroid Moment Tensor with strike = 0Â°, dip = +20Â° and rake = +45Â°, which guar- antees the absence of nodal lines and comparable amplitudes of SV and SH at the receivers in the equatorial zone of the eastern azimuthal sector and at the slowness of Sdiff. To obtain the displacement synthetic seismograms, the com- puted numerical Green functions are convolved with the - t /6.5 Gaussian source time function e . 2 Validation of the Method  [ ] Because we are going to study in detail some small 10 amplitude effects for velocity models whose differences are small from a numerical point of view (Â±3%), we want to make sure that our numerical code is reliable to model such effects. The SEM has been validated for global seismology down to periods of 10 to 15 seconds in many articles [e.g., Komatitsch and Tromp , 2002a, 2002b; Chaljub and Valette , 2004; Chaljub et al. , 2007] but because of the much shorter periods involved in this study we perform a thorough veri-  fication by comparing our results for 1 D models to a  normal mode solution, to the Direct Solution Method (DSM) [ Geller and Ohminato , 1994; Takeuchi et al. , 2000; Kawai ' et al. , 2006] and to a calculation of the Green s function of the Earth by Minor Integration (GEMINI) [ Friederich and Dalkolmo , 1995], three techniques that can accurately com-   pute the response of 1 D spherically symmetric Earth models (only) at relatively high frequencies. [ ] It is very difficult to compute a reliable full catalog 11 of spheroidal modes below periods of 7 or 8 seconds [e.g., Dahlen and Tromp , 1998, p. 301; Kawai et al. , 2006], although recent work seems to have improved the situation  [ Al Attar and Woodhouse , 2008]. We therefore computed only the toroidal modes down to a period of 3.3 seconds using the Mineos2007 software package, originally written by F. Gilbert, G. Masters and J. Woodhouse [e.g., Dahlen and Tromp , 1998, p. 284] and modified by L. Zhao. This means  that by normal mode summation we only compute the SH component of the wave field. [ ] We compare the synthetics obtained by SEM, DSM, 12  GEMINI and normal mode summation along the equatorial profile at an epicentral distance of 100Â° for two models: our smoothed version of IASP91 [ Kennett and Engdahl , 1991] and a modified IASP91 with the S velocity increased by 3%  and the P velocity increased by 1% in D , respectively. The  thickness of D is 149 km. The fit of the synthetics com- puted by the different methods is almost perfect for both SV  and SH (Figure 2). The small long period discrepancy that can be seen between 1650 s and 1700 s probably comes 1 Auxiliary materials are available at ftp://ftp.agu.org/jb/2009jb0006795. 3of13  B07312 SVDIFF SPLITTING from the DSM and GEMINI solutions because these methods require summation of harmonics up to very high angular orders and use a small complex damping term to accurately compute the long periods for a shallow source [ Kawai et al. , 2006]. [ ] Let us mention that in the SEM no particular 13  assumption or simplification is made in the case of 1 D  spherically symmetric Earth models. One uses the general  formulation for 3 D models [see, e.g., Komatitsch and Tromp , 2002a, 2002b; Chaljub and Valette , 2004; Chaljub et al. , 2007] and therefore, the SEM formulation does not "" ""  know that the model is 1 D and we can be confident that  the SEM will also be very accurate for 3 D models below. "
142 kom jgrb16319.pdf,RD,Journal of Geophysical Research,"D Models [ ] We first explore the properties of diffracted wave 14   fields for a few 1 D models. The thickness of the D layer, in which the S wave velocity changes with a negligible gradient from 7.27 km/s at the top to 7.30 km/s at the bottom, is 149 km. We will analyze models with Â±3% and  Â±1% perturbations of the S and P wave speeds in D ,  respectively, and a model with a doubled D thickness - - (300 km instead of 149 km) and 3% and 1% perturbations  of the S and P wave speeds in D , respectively. From now on we will show velocity instead of displacement as in Figure 2. This shifts the spectrum toward shorter periods and the resulting waveforms therefore look similar to those that  are recorded by standard broad band seismographs and used in studies of Sdiff splitting. [ ] The dominant period in the amplitude spectrum of ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi p 15 p 6 : 5 our synthetic velocity seismograms is = 8 s, and they have significant energy down to approximately 5 seconds. We will display the synthetics along the equatorial profile with a reduction slowness of 8.3 s/Â°, which makes Sdiff with a standard apparent velocity arrive at about the same time independently of the epicentral distance. Slower propagation is then indicated by arrival times that increase with epicentral distance, and arrival times that decrease with epicentral distance indicate a higher apparent velocity. [ ] Figures 3a, 4a and 5a show synthetics for the stan- 16 dard model and the model with higher velocities using true amplitudes, and Figures 3b, 4b and 5b show the same sections   but with self normalized amplitudes. Self normalization means that each trace is normalized independently with respect to its own maximum amplitude. True amplitudes represent the amplitude decay of SVdiff and SHdiff as a function of epicentral distance in the right fashion, while   self normalization helps to see small amplitude arrivals. In the standard model, the amplitude decay of SVdiff as a function of epicentral distance is large compared to SHdiff, and at a distance of 105Â° the amplitude of SHdiff becomes several times that of SVdiff (Figure 3a). Nevertheless, in the  self normalized seismograms SVdiff is well seen up to a distance of 120Â° (Figure 3b). The difference in amplitude decay of SVdiff and SHdiff is known from previous studies: at small epicentral distances the inefficient propagation of SVdiff is attributed mainly to a destructive interference between SVdiff and ScSV and to the large density increase at the CMB [ Chapman and Phinney , 1972]; and in the deep shadow zone, large attenuation of SVdiff is caused by the leakage of P and S energy away from the CMB interface c(""["", ""Phinney and Alexander"", "", 1966;"", ""Chapman and Phinney"", "", 1972]."", ""In contrast, horizontally"", """", ""polarized diffracted waves are"", ""not coupled to these modes, and thus experience weaker"", ""attenuation."", ""["", ""17"", ""] The self"", """", ""normalized seismograms (Figure 3b) exhibit"", ""a delay of SVdiff relative to SHdiff that increases with"", ""distance from 0.0 s at a distance of 94Â° to 2.4 s at a distance"", ""of 120Â°.

The pronounced change of the amplitude pattern at a distance of around 110Â° corresponds to the onset of diffraction. In the distance interval from 114Â° to 120Â° SV arrives with a delay of up to 2.0 s relative to SH; the delay is accompanied by a large amplitude decay of SV relative to SH. This relation- ship between the delay and attenuation for SVdiff follows  the regularity found for the D with a standard thickness.  Models [ ] We now consider models with velocities that differ 24 in the southern and northern hemispheres, each hemisphere  being similar to one of the 1 D models of the previous  section. We study models of D in which the northern hemisphere is a modified version of IASP91 (either faster or slower by 3% for the shear wave velocity) and the southern hemisphere corresponds to IASP91. Although such models  are very simple compared to the true heterogeneities of D  in the real Earth, the propagation path of Sdiff in D is usually only around 10Â° to 20Â° long and such models can therefore simulate Sdiff phases traveling along the edges of large natural structures such as superplumes. [ ] Along the equatorial profile in a model with a slower 25 northern hemisphere (Figure 8) SHdiff splits into two phases of comparable amplitude, the first corresponding to the standard velocity in the southern hemisphere and the second corresponding to slower propagation in the northern hemi- 8of13  B07312 SVDIFF SPLITTING  hand side represent the epicentral dis- sphere. Details of the SV wave field are better seen in the  self normalized traces (Figure 8b). SVdiff also splits into two arrivals, but the fast split wave has smaller amplitudes, longer periods, and a lower apparent velocity compared to the fast SHdiff. At a distance of 120Â° the first clearly visible SVdiff is delayed by 12.0 s relative to the first visible SHdiff. Synthetics along a meridional profile at a longitude - of 110Â° (Figure 9) show that to the south of 2Â° SVdiff is  delayed relative to SHdiff by 1.5 s. The delay is well seen  on the self normalized traces in Figure 9b, and the wave  field is similar to that for the corresponding 1 D model (IASP91) in the southern hemisphere (Figure 3). The wave  field to the north of +4Â° is similar to that for the 1 D model in Figure 6a: SHdiff and SVdiff arrive at the same time, but  the peak of SHdiff is delayed relative to SVdiff by 1.5 s. - The wave field between 2Â° and +4Â° is similar to that in the equatorial profile, which means that the corridor that is re- presented by the equatorial profile is about 6Â° wide and asymmetric. The first clearly visible SVdiff arrival can be delayed in this corridor by up to 8 s; this of course depends on the epicentral distance.  [ ] For self normalized synthetics in the equatorial profile 26 for the model with a faster northern hemisphere (Figure 10b) at distances larger than 110Â°, SHdiff splits into fast and slow arrivals, with a delay of the slow phase between 6 and 9 s. SVdiff apparently splits as well, but the fast SV wave is too small relative to SHdiff to be seen clearly. The apparent velocity of the main SV phase is much smaller than ex-   pected for SVdiff.

Higher amplification would be required to see it more clearly. This SVdiff is qualitatively similar to the SVdiff in  the synthetics for the 1 D model IASP91 (Figure 3). The slow SHdiff is followed by SVdiff, which is delayed by up to 5 s at a distance of 120Â°. This delay is a combined effect  of propagation in the low velocity northern hemisphere as in Figure 6b and of inefficient propagation in the southern hemisphere as in Figure 8."
142 kom jgrb16319.pdf,C,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Discussion and Conclusions  [ ] We have demonstrated that even in the 1 D isotropic 28 IASP91 model SVdiff may arrive later than SHdiff with a delay of a few seconds (Figure 3). This effect is also    observed in 1 D models with a high velocity D (Figure 5)   or a low velocity D with a doubled thickness (Figure 6b). The delay is always accompanied by a large amplitude decay of SVdiff as a function of epicentral distance. In the   low velocity D with a standard thickness, amplitude decay of SVdiff is small and the delay of SVdiff relative to SHdiff is not observed (Figure 6a). The correlation between the velocity and amplitude decay of SVdiff resembles the effect of anelasticity. Note that the small amplitude of SVdiff relative to SHdiff in Figures 3 and 5 does not mean that this SVdiff cannot be seen in actual seismograms: depending on the focal mechanism, the amplitude ratio between SVdiff and SHdiff can be large in the vicinity of nodal lines for SH. Focusing/defocusing of SV and SH by lateral hetero- geneities may affect this ratio as well. [ ] A different sensitivity of SVdiff and SHdiff ampli- 29  tudes to the shear wave velocity in D leads to a specific  phenomenon in a laterally heterogeneous D : SVdiff tends c(""to choose low"", """", ""S"", """", ""velocity propagation paths, whereas SHdiff"", ""propagates in both high"", """", ""and low"", """", ""velocity regions of D"", """", ""with comparable efficiency.

Introduction The discovery of low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) as a component of tectonic tremor presents a novel and unexplored means of studying local subduction zone structure. At the time that LFEs were originally discovered in SW Japan as discrete events on seismograms, their relation to episodic tremor and slip (ETS) had not yet been ascertained [ Nishide et al. , 2000; Beroza and Ide , 2011]. Later work using network correla- tion methods showed that tectonic tremor can be considered as a superposition of many LFEs undergoing repeated ruptures at a range of different earthquake locations [ Shelly et al. , 2007]. Correlation methods have been used to identify LFE events among tremor signals in both SW Japan [ Shelly et al. , 2006; Brown et al. , . 2009] and Cascadia [ Brownetal. , 2009; Bostock et al. , 2012]. LFEs are small earthquakes ( M  2 0 ) with char- w acteristic frequencies of 1Â­10 Hz that result from shear slip at the plate boundary [ Shelly et al. , 2007; Ide et al. , 2007; Royer and Bostock , 2013]. The predominantly horizontal motion of the rupture leads to strong S -wave arrivals on horizontal component seismograms at small epicentral distances. The consistent mechanism and local nature of LFEs suggest their use as a new seismic source to image regional subduction zone struc- ture. In the Cascadia subduction zone where regular seismicity is relatively scarce, LFEs present a potentially valuable imaging tool. 1.1. Elastic Anisotropy Elastic anisotropy refers to the property of a medium whereby the velocity of a seismic wave depends on its direction of propagation and polarization. As a linearly polarized S -wave enters an anisotropic medium it is usually split into two quasi S -waves, qS and qS , that are orthogonal and have polarization directions 1 2 determined by the elastic properties of the medium. A commonly assumed form of anisotropy is transverse Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011321 isotropy, which has one axis of symmetry. If the propagation direction of an incoming S -wave lies along the axis of symmetry, the S -wave is not split nor is the vibration direction altered. For other directions of propagation, the S -wave is generally split into two waves with different velocities. The velocity difference  results in a delay time t between the qS and qS waves, the magnitude of which depends on the strength 1 2 of anisotropy. More specifically, the integrated time delay is dependent on the difference between fast and slow wave speeds along with the extent of the anisotropic material. In order to observe and characterize   shear wave splitting, the delay time t and the fast polarization direction are typically measured. Split- ting measurements can be used to map anisotropy and subsequently can be related to past or present deformation processes. 1.2. Prior Studies The North American plate overrides the subducting Juan de Fuca plate in Cascadia and exhibits crustal anisotropy that has been documented in earlier S -wave splitting analyses of southern Vancouver Island [ Cassidy and Bostock , 1996; Currie et al. , 2001; Balfour et al. , 2012; Bostock and Christensen , 2012]. The origins of crustal anisotropy are often disputed but are generally ascribed to either stress-aligned fluid-saturated fractures [e.g., Crampin , 1994; Crampin and Peacock , 2005] or the preferred mineral orientation of rocks [e.g., Christensen , 1965, 1966]. Cassidy and Bostock [1996] conducted a single-station S -wave splitting analysis using shallow (15Â­30 km) and deep (40Â­65 km) crustal earthquakes on southern Vancouver Island and sug- gested that anisotropy was stronger in the upper 20 km of the continental crust. Currie et al. [2001] used crustal earthquakes recorded at 16 additional stations distributed across the Cascadia margin. Correspon- dence between fast polarization directions and local stress estimates acquired from focal mechanisms, and borehole studies were interpreted as anisotropy predominantly resulting from stress-aligned fluid-saturated fractures. Balfour et al. [2012] provided a more comprehensive splitting analysis of southern Vancouver Island by utilizing an increased number of crustal and intraslab earthquakes over an expanded station distribution. They compared fast polarization directions to stress estimates acquired from inversion [ Balfour et al. , 2011] and found reasonable agreement, thereby attributing anisotropy on southern Vancouver Island to stress-aligned fluid-saturated fractures. Bostock and Christensen [2012] measured splitting in tremor waveforms and yielded fast polarization directions trending approximately E-W for the majority of mainland stations on southern Vancouver Island. Contrary to earlier studies, Bostock and Christensen [2012] suggested that anisotropy was primarily caused by the preferred mineral orientation of the Leech River Complex, a metamorphosed accretionary terrane located on southern Vancouver Island. We seek to provide further insight into the cause of anisotropy beneath southern Vancouver Island using LFEs. In Cascadia, LFEs gener- ate waves that propagate upward through the forearc crust of the North American plate. Consequently, any anisotropy observed at nearby stations can be attributed directly to local crustal anisotropy as the observed waveforms have not encountered any contribution from mantle structure. Sections 2Â­4 of this study focus solely on southern Vancouver Island for which the analysis is divided into two components. In the first part (sections 2 and 3), we outline and conduct a splitting analysis of LFE data, present observations, and compare them with previous studies of crustal anisotropy in the region. We then expand on the work of Bostock and Christensen [2012] by developing anisotropic models for south- ern Vancouver Island and computing synthetic seismograms using a spectral element method (section 4). We continue to develop the hypothesis that crustal anisotropy in the region is primarily influenced by mineral orientation of metamorphic rocks from the Leech River Complex, as opposed to stress-aligned fluid-saturated cracks. In section 5 we include a less extensive splitting analysis for LFE data from northern Washington, an extension that permits a more comprehensive interpretation of anisotropy in the north- ern Cascadia forearc crust. Metamorphosed accretionary terranes are global features in subduction zone forearcs. Observations on anisotropy from southern Vancouver Island could have global implications for anisotropy in forearcs crusts. 2. LFE Templates An LFE template comprises high signal-to-noise ratio stacks of 100s to 1000s of repeating LFEs, occurring 2 within a highly localized ( 1km ) source region, for a suite of stations [ Royer and Bostock , 2013]. The LFE  templates [ Bostock et al. , 2012; Royer and Bostock , 2013] used in this study were generated using network correlation methods [ Shelly et al. , 2006; Brown et al. , 2008] on ETS episodes occurring in 2003 to 2013 along southern Vancouver Island over a set of seven anchor stations. A group of initial LFE templates were sub- ject to a network cross correlation over an expanded range of stations (Figure 1) in an iterative manner that c(""Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth"", ""10.1002/2014JB011321"", ""Figure 1."", ""(left) Map of Cascadia margin.

Methodology   We perform a standard, two-parameter S -wave splitting analysis that searches for t and that minimize the  second eigenvalue of the covariance matrix for the shifted and rotated horizontal component seismo- 2 grams [ Silver and Chan , 1991]. This procedure serves to maximize the linearity of the particle motion thereby identifying the original, unsplit S waveform, assuming that the medium is adequately modeled by constant anisotropy. The eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the corrected covariance matrix is Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011321 Figure 3.

Figure 4 shows stages of the splitting 0 analysis at station TWKB for LFE template 002. The standard splitting analysis is susceptible to null measurements that occur when there is an inherent lack of anisotropy along the raypath, when a wave propagates along the axis of symmetry in a transversely isotropic medium, or when the initial polarization direction is coincident with the fast or slow direction. For a      parameter combination ( , t ) that minimizes ( , t ) of the splitting analysis (Figure 4c), there are three m m 2 scenarios under which the measurement is deemed null:         1. If , or t 0 lie within the 95% confidence level ( )of ( , t ) + = 0 0 2 m m 2  &gt;  2. t t , where t is an upper limit imposed based upon realistic expectations for measurements in m max max the region (set at 0.3 s) [e.g., Cassidy and Bostock , 1996; Currie et al. , 2001; Balfour et al. , 2012; Bostock and Christensen , 2012].         3. Both or and t 0 lie within 2 of ( , t ). + = 0 0 2 m m 2 The final criterion was chosen due to empirical evidence that showed measurements falling into this cate- gory consistently failed to follow expected splitting behavior. The 95% confidence levels and error estimates are computed assuming an F-distribution as specified by Silver and Chan [1991]. Walsh et al. [2013] demon- strated that portions of Silver and Chan [1991] formulation used to compute confidence intervals and standard errors resulted in biases, instead providing underestimates of the desired values. We acknowledge   that our errors and confidence intervals will therefore be underestimated. Hereafter, usage of and t refers   exclusively to solutions of the splitting analysis, and t , respectively. m m Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011321 Figure 4.

Forward Modeling We seek to test the validity of the assertion that crustal anisotropy in southern Vancouver Island is pri- marily a result of mineral orientation in metamorphic rocks. We employ the spectral element method to compute synthetic seismograms in 3-D anisotropic models [ Komatitsch and Tromp , 1999; Komatitsch et al. , 2000]. The spectral element method allows for accurate solutions to the full elastic wave equation with general anisotropy represented by 21 independent elastic constants. We develop a conceptually simple  and geologically justifiable model that captures the systematic trends in , with less attention paid to precise matching of split times. Split times are dictated by both the extent and strength of anisotropic mate- rial, thus making detailed assumptions about either is problematic given the lack of information on their respective distributions. 4.1. Initial Model and LFE Source  . We develop a regional mesh that encompasses the southern Vancouver Island region lying between 48 2    . . . and 48 8 latitude and - 123 0 and - 124 75 longitude and translates to a region of approximately 130 km Ã— 65 km in the E-W and N-S directions, respectively. The mesh extends to a depth of 50 km, enclos- ing the LFE distribution while maintaining a sufficient distance from the domain boundaries to mitigate the influence of boundary reflections. Absorbing boundary conditions are applied, and a realistic topography and bathymetry model is used. We use a 3-D P -wave velocity model [ Ramachandran et al. , 2006] and com- pute S -wave speeds using a constant V V ratio of 1.76, an average value for continental crust [ Christensen ,  p s 1996]. Density is computed using a wave speed-based empirical relation for crustal rocks [ Brocher , 2005]. We employ a purely isotropic background model upon which we superpose various anisotropic perturbation models. Two mesh doubling layers are implemented to maintain a similar number of grid points per wave- length throughout the mesh. The minimum period resolvable by the mesh is  0.6 s. Although LFE template waveforms display characteristic frequencies of 1Â­10 Hz, modeling was restricted to frequencies between 0.5 and 1.67 Hz, a decision that was dictated by considerations of numerical cost. A splitting analysis of LFE data bandpass filtered between 0.5 and 1.67 Hz (frequency band for synthetics) produced largely similar results to those from standard LFE data bandpass filtered between 1 and 10 Hz. The splitting analysis of 1Â­10 Hz bandpass-filtered LFE data led to more robust results, therefore are used for later splitting compar- isons between data and synthetics. It should be noted that we chose not to include the explicit signature of the (3Â­4 km) low-velocity, high V V zone that sits at the top of the subducting plate [ Hansen et al. , 2012].  p s Any reflections/conversions therefrom should arrive as S -waves within the S -wave window with geometries   similar to direct S . Hence, they should not alter estimates of t or . Due to the considerable similarity of LFE focal mechanisms over the entire suite of LFE events [ Royer and Bostock , 2013] we use a single representative moment tensor for all LFEs when conducting numerical simulations (Figure 6). 4.2. Leech River Complex Anisotropy Model We expand upon the premise discussed in Bostock and Christensen [2012] that crustal anisotropy in south- ern Vancouver Island is primarily a result of mineral orientation in the Leech River Complex. P -wave and S -wave velocities for a range of Leech River schist and phyllite samples demonstrate transverse isotropy with a symmetry axis perpendicular to their foliation and fast directions parallel to the foliation [ Bostock and Christensen , 2012]. We first review prior constraints on geometry of the Leech River Complex. The surface expression of the Leech River Complex is bounded by three faults; the Leech River fault, San Juan fault, and the Survey Moun- tain fault (Figure 1). Seismic reflection surveys reveal the Leech River fault and Survey Mountain fault to  be thrust faults, dipping to the northeast at 35Â­45 to a depth of 10 km [ Clowes et al. , 1987a; Green et al. ,  1987]. Subsequent reprocessing of select data [ Green et al. , 1987] reveals an undulating Leech River fault that  begins as a steeply dipping (60 ) fault near the surface and becomes shallowly dipping past 3 km depth. A lack of a reflection signature for the San Juan fault was interpreted as indication of a steep northward dip of  60Â­70 . Reflection imaging off the west coast of southern Vancouver Island suggests that the Leech River fault and San Juan fault are both steeply dipping and merge at  13 km depth [ Clowesetal. , 1987b]. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011321 We implement azimuthal anisotropy by assuming that anisotropy can be represented as a transversely isotropic medium with the symmetry axis oriented in the horizontal plane . The appropriate elastic tensor is computed using velocity measurements for a Leech River Complex schist sample (L-4 schist sample from Bostock and Christensen [2012]). The L-4 sample exhibits transverse isotropy with S -wave anisotropy of 11%, a relatively conservative value in comparison to other schistose rocks from the Leech River Complex that can exhibit S -wave anisotropy up to 30%. Orienting the symmetry axis within the horizontal plane equates to modeling a vertically dipping foliation as is prevalent in surface exposures of the Leech River Com- plex [ Fairchild and Cowan , 1982]. The two main adjustable parameters are the spatial extent of anisotropy and the orientation of symmetry axis in the horizontal plane. We test a range of models and present the preferred model."

Moreover, the LFE measurements extend spatial coverage to stations along the southeast coast of southern Vancouver Island. A comparison between our fast polarization directions and those of Balfour et al. [2012] is displayed in Figure 9; agreement is mixed and will be addressed in section 3.3. Figure 9 presents splitting measurements as a function of azimuth and incidence angle. We note some  degree of azimuthal variation in at select stations. Where present, azimuthal variations manifest as spa-  tially coherent clusters of similar . Stations PGC, LZB, and TWKB exhibit approximately E-W fast directions  for southwestern azimuths yet trend closer to NW-SE for southeastern azimuths. At SOKB, is rotated counterclockwise for events originating from eastern azimuths when compared to events to from the north-  west. Similarity in azimuthal variations of between neighboring stations suggest that these small-scale variations are genuine indications of heterogeneous anisotropy. Two such examples include station pairs TWKB/LZB and KELB/PGC (Figure 9). 3.2.3. Delay Times Delay times across all stations and events vary between 0.05 and 0.3 s, whereas mean values over all stations vary between 0.1 and 0.21 s. We do not observe any systematic variation in delay time with back-azimuth (Figure 9), with the possible exception of station TWKB. Bostock and Christensen [2012] reported larger delay  .  times corresponding to northerly azimuths with an average t 0 22 s, as opposed to an average t = = . 0 07 s for events from southwestern azimuths; we observe a similar but less definitive trend. Whereas we &gt; lack measurements from northerly azimuths, the northern most events display larger split times ( 0.2 s) and decrease for southwestern azimuths, with delay times ranging between 0 and 0.2 s. Figure 10 displays   histograms of delay times ( t ) for an east-to-west line of stations. We observe an increase in average t from east to west, with maximum values occurring at TSJB. The large variance within the histograms hint at a strongly heterogeneous strength of anisotropy. Measured delay times are generally larger than those of Balfour et al. [2012] and will be addressed in later discussion. Schistose rocks are known to cause splitting due to preferred mineral orientation [ Christensen , 1966; Godfrey et al. , 2000; Brocher et al. , 1989]; thus, we chose to investigate the potential influence of lithology on splitting measurements by combining laboratory measurements of Leech River Complex rock samples with structural information available on the geometry of the Leech River Complex (section 4). 3.3. Comparison With a Prior Forearc Study We herein refer to Balfour et al. [2012] as BCDM for brevity. We credit the somewhat complementary event distributions as the primary contributor to the discrepancies in splitting measurements between the two studies. LFE epicenters occur predominantly on mainland southern Vancouver Island and arrive with subvertical incidence angles, whereas BCDM epicenters tend to lie along the coasts and arrive with shal- lower incidence angles. Figure 3 is a representative display of the respective distributions. Shared raypaths between LFE and crustal/instraslab events exist but are limited. The variable sampling of the crust could lead to inherent sampling bias in the average splitting measurements. In the presence of heterogeneous anisotropy, these differences become more difficult to verify and interpret. Sampling bias may explain why   average from BCDM are consistently rotated clockwise relative to average determined in this study c(""Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth"", ""10.1002/2014JB011321"", ""Figure 9."", ""Equal area plots displaying"", """", ""t"", ""and"", """", ""for all stations.

The generally longer period of LFEs in comparison to regular seismicity may explain instances of larger LFE delay times. In general, the splitting measurements for LFE templates and BCDM appear to reflect different sampling of a heterogeneous, anisotropic crust. 4.3. Preferred Model and Results A basic anisotropic model of a homogeneous block of horizontal transversely isotropic material with a symmetry axis oriented due north (E-W oriented foliation) is improved by iteratively increasing model com-  plexity to reduce discrepancies between observed and synthetic . At the first iteration we alter the Leech River Complex spatial geometry following the constraints established in section 4.2. In later iterations we include differing anisotropic orientations. In four iterations we reach a viable anisotropic model (Figure 11a). The Leech River fault and Survey Moun-   tain fault both dip shallowly at 30 to N35 E, respectively; the preferred dip of these faults lie slightly below  the lower estimates from reflection surveys [ Clowes et al. , 1987a]. The San Juan fault dips steeply (70 )to the north and becomes shallower past 6 km to accommodate the interpretation that the San Juan fault represents a listric thrust fault [ Clowesetal. , 1987a]. Projections of the dipping Leech River Complex bound- ing faults extend to 12 km depth and terminate forming a wedge of north/northeast trending material. Anisotropy in the model is divided into two distinct regions. In region 1, the symmetry axis is oriented due north and simulates a region of material with E-W trending foliation. Region 2 has foliation that is oriented  subparallel to the strike of the Survey Mountain fault, with a symmetry axis oriented at N35 E. The inferred  rock type in regions 1 and 2 varies only in the orientation of the foliation. We select a subset of 50 LFEs with ray geometries that encounter the anisotropic wedge model of the Leech River Complex to perform forward modeling. The synthetic data vary more systematically, and the signa- ture of the two distinct anisotropic regions is clearly observed (Figure 11). We capture the general E-W fast direction trend for western POLARIS-BC stations, along with the transition to NW-SE fast directions for more easterly stations (e.g., TWKB and KHVB) (Figure 11b). While the aggregate behavior is reasonably recovered, comparing the results for individual events/stations identifies deficiencies in the model. Figure 10 includes the delay times for the synthetic data in comparison to LFE template measurements, dis- playing fair overall agreement. The correspondence between trends of increasing average delay times from east to west is notable and could further support Leech River Complex based anisotropy. Instances where   split times are improperly matched can be observed through residuals, r = t - t (Figures 11dÂ­11e). obs syn &gt; &lt; Geographical clusters of slow ( r 0 ) or fast ( r 0 ) residuals are indicative of regions where anisotropy is too weak/strong along the corresponding raypaths. Fast residuals are prevalent at station LZB, which is  reflected in the greater mean t for synthetics (Figure 10). TSJB displays both fast and slow residuals; over- all agreement is strongest at TWKB. The deficiencies in the current model can be attributed to an imperfect model geometry that fails to capture complex lithology, particularly near the fault junction of the San Juan fault and Survey Mountain fault. Fairchild and Cowan [1982] documented an increase in metamorphic grade from north to south from greenschist to amphibolite facies. Variable metamorphic grade (and consequently strength of anisotropy) is not reproduced in the current model, thereby presenting another potential source of error. With the current methods it is not possible to distinguish between the two sources of error. Stations SOKB, GLBC, and VGZ all show significant splitting with strong preferred directions for LFE template measurements, yet the current anisotropic model fails to reproduce splitting for synthetic seismograms (a single measurement at GLBC is the exception). The absence of a splitting signature is anticipated, as the corresponding LFE raypaths for these stations do not encounter the synthetic Leech River Complex anisotropy. Further adjustments, that honor prior geological constraints, could likely be made to improve agreement at stations VGZ and SHVB. This is not the case for other stations, where significant, implausible alterations would have to be made to account for anisotropy under an Leech River Complex model.

Northern Washington Although our focus in this paper is to ascertain the nature of anisotropy below southern Vancouver Island, it will prove insightful in this respect to consider splitting measurements of LFE templates determined for stations immediately to the south below northern Washington state. LFE data for northern Washington were obtained using the same correlation methods used for southern Vancouver Island in section 2. For fur- ther details, the reader is referred to Royer and Bostock [2013]. We perform a splitting analysis, as outlined in section 3, for 100 LFE templates at 14 stations to produce 236 valid splitting measurements out of 1400  potential source-receiver pairs. Figure 12 displays rose histograms of at station locations along with equal  area plots of for select stations. Splitting measurements are significantly less ordered and more complex than those on southern Vancouver Island. Mean delay times range from 0.1 to 0.15 s and are compara- ble in magnitude to delay times observed on southern Vancouver Island. Fast directions are scattered and  exhibit significant variability in behavior between neighboring stations. Observations of for single stations exhibit variations with both azimuth and incidence angle (Figure 12), stations W020 and GNW are two such  examples. Station W020 displays near N-S at small incidence angles but trends closer to NE-SW for larger incidence angles. Azimuthal variations are somewhat consistent between neighboring stations suggesting that the variability is a genuine result of complex anisotropy. Complex anisotropy could be a consequence of highly deformed metamorphosed core rocks from the Olympic peninsula. 6.1.

While some of the observed fast directions on northern Washington coin-  cide with the local directions (e.g., select azimuths at stations W020, W030, and GNW), the majority do Hmax not. The complex splitting patterns observed on northern Washington could be a result of multiple sources of anisotropy that include crack-induced anisotropy. 6.2. Mineral-Preferred Orientation of the Leech River Complex We assert that the anisotropy we observe on mainland southern Vancouver Island is primarily a result of the preferred mineral orientation of highly anisotropic rocks from the Leech River Complex. The geology of the Leech River Complex suggests a model with horizontal transverse isotropy that adequately explains the observed splitting measurements. Considered to have accumulated during the late Mesozoic era, the Leech River Complex is mostly composed of metamorphosed phyllites and schists that exhibit pervasive foliations with strong phyllosilcate lattice-preferred orientations [ Fairchild and Cowan , 1982; Cowan , 2003] Extensive structural analyses determined that two major deformational events occurred, likely in the early Tertiary, with the latter generating slaty cleavage and schistosity [ Fairchild and Cowan , 1982; Rusmore and Cowan , 1985]. Orientations of foliated planar folds produced by the second deformation are consistently steeply dipping and strike approximately east-west. Metamorphism ended in the middle to late Eocene, and later deformation associated with the southern bounding Leech River fault does not appear to extend any significant distance into the Leech River Complex [ Fairchild and Cowan , 1982]; thus, the internal struc- ture of the Leech River fault is likely not significant to our observations of anisotropy. Although exposures are poor, there is, however, some indication that the San Juan and Survey Mountain faults may at least locally be robust enough to contribute to splitting. The transversely isotropic Leech River Complex schists and phyllites [ Bostock and Christensen , 2012] and observations of structural geology imply a source of azimuthal anisotropy generated by a horizontal transversely isotropic medium with a slow axis normal to the plane of foliation. The implementation of such a model in the forward modeling confirms the validity of an anisotropy model based upon preferred mineral orientation of the Leech River Complex.  E-W trending observed at mainland POLARIS-BC stations are consistent with the east-west striking foliation in the main body of the Leech River Complex. Geologic mapping suggests that the foliation trend rotates to the east, becoming subparallel to the strike of the Survey Mountain fault yet remains steeply/vertically dipping [ Muller , 1983; Mayrand et al. , 1987]. By incorporating this change in dominant  foliation direction in our forward model, we can recreate the NW-SE observed for some eastern stations using a north/northeast dipping wedge model that extends to 12 km. While the assumption that the foli- ation is vertically dipping throughout the Leech River Complex may not be valid, highly anisotropic Leech River Complex schists and phyllites (up to 30 % S -wave anisotropy) can generate up to 0.3 s splitting with a uniform thickness of as little as 2Â­3 km [ Bostock and Christensen , 2012]. The trade-off between extent and strength of anisotropy allows for a shallower extent of vertically dipping foliation provided anisotropy is stronger, thereby supplying a more plausible alternative. The heterogeneous magnitude of anisotropy indicated by the increase in delay times from east to west could be due to the lateral variations in the extent or fabric orientation of the Leech River Complex. Delay times from forward modeling display a similar trend but exhibit greater variance in delay times at select sta- tions (Figure 10). The synthetic wedge model is thickest below TSJB/TWBB/TWGB, whereas to the east the dipping arm of the Leech River Complex is significantly thinner. An alternative explanation relates to fault zone mylonites as observed in the Brevard fault zone, a continental strike-slip/thrust fault. Above 200 MPa mylonitic metamorphic rocks of the fault zone were found to exhibit transverse isotropy due to preferred mineral orientation, which at lower pressures is enhanced by oriented cracks [ Christensen and Szymanski , 1988]. The presence of similar fault zone rocks in the bounding faults of the Leech River Complex may also explain why delay times are increased for stations in close proximity to the faults. Increased proxim- ity of western stations to Leech River Complex fault zones presents another potential explanation for the east-to-west increase in delay times.  At select stations across southern Vancouver Island we find t increases as a function of event depth (Figure 13a). Although the delay times show considerable scatter, a majority of stations exhibit the afore- mentioned trend. This observation is consistent with the interpretation of anisotropy resulting from the Leech River block dipping to the north/northeast. Deeper LFEs generally correspond to more northeasterly LFE epicenters owing to plate geometry. For a north/northeast dipping Leech River block, deeper LFEs incur Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011321 Figure 13. Delay time plotted as a function of depth for a selection of stations in an approximate east-to-west line (see Figure 1). Blue dots represent delay  times measured for LFE data and display a weak correlation for increasing t as a function of event depth at the majority of stations. Green dots represent delay time measurements for synthetic LFE data obtained via anisotropic modeling. Red and black lines show best linear fits for data and synthetics, respectively. For  synthetics, all stations show trends for increasing t with depth and are more tightly defined that those for LFE data. longer raypaths through anisotropic material, thereby accruing larger delay times. This is reaffirmed by delay times from our anisotropic forward modeling (Figure 13b) that demonstrate similar but more tightly defined positive trends at all select stations. The azimuthal variations observed at LZB and TWKB are reproduced by the two domain synthetic Leech  River Complex model. Western azimuths record preferentially oriented E-W, whereas eastern azimuths tend toward NW-SE (Figure 11). It is conceivable that anisotropy related to maximum horizontal compressive stress is a more slowly varying function of position in comparison to anisotropy due to mineral orienta-  tion; thus, given the stress model established earlier we do not attribute the azimuthal variations in to   local variations in . We interpret spatial clusters of as an indication for heterogeneous anisotropy on Hmax southern Vancouver Island resulting from complex lithology with preferred mineral orientation that leads to  small-scale azimuthal variations in . 6.3. Mineral-Preferred Orientation of the Olympic Peninsula The core rocks of the Olympic peninsula (Figure 14) are composed of two major accretionary terranes; western core rocks are non-slaty and locally coherent, whereas the slaty eastern core rocks are pervasively sheared and exhibit well-developed slaty cleavage. The eastern core is predominantly composed of shale, sandstone, and siltstone that have been variously metamorphosed to slate, semischist, and phyllites. Core units form long irregular packets that vary between disrupted formations of sandstone/semischist with slate/phyllite to relatively intact interbedded sandstone and slate [ Tabor and Cady , 1978]. Whereas sand- stone is seismically isotropic, velocity measurements on Olympic core slates indicate that they exhibit c(""Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth"", ""10.1002/2014JB011321"", ""Figure 14."", ""Schematic diagrams illustrating geological terrane and interpreted depth sections.

Although structural details of the core rocks show considerable complexity, they provide a coherent model of slates with a fan of cleavage extending asymmetrically to the east with dips increasing to near vertical from west to east [ Tabor and Cady , 1978]. Of importance is the overall continuity of the slaty cleavage over distances of several kilometers, a condition that is favorable to generate observable seismic anisotropy. Tomography [ Ramachandran et al. , 2006] and reflection [ Clowesetal. , 1987a] studies have postulated that the Olympic core rocks are underthrust beneath the Eocene basalts of northern Washington and southern Vancouver Island as illustrated in the schematic diagrams in Figure 14. Figure 14b presents an interpreted geologic profile along BB' based upon Clowes et al. [1987a] and includes reflectors imaged in the study. A dipping reflector beneath southern Vancouver Island was interpreted as the northward continuation of the Hurricane Ridge fault that is underlain by core rocks from the Olympic peninsula. The potential pres- ence of anisotropic slate from the Olympic core beneath southern Vancouver Island presents a third source of anisotropy that could explain anisotropy for stations such as SOKB, GLBC, SSIB, and others from south- ern Vancouver Island that we have not associated with the Leech River Complex. In addition, potential 3 field studies beneath southern Vancouver Island identified a region of higher-density (3140 kg/m )mate- rial underlying the Eocene basalts and Leech River Complex with a lower boundary defined by the E -layer [ Dehler and Clowes , 1992]. This region has been interpreted as either underplated metamorphosed frag- ments of the Leech River Complex/Eocene basalts or high-density rocks resulting from metamorphism of accreted sedimentary rocks. If the metamorphic rocks exhibit strong preferred mineral orientation, they could represent a source of deep crustal anisotropy that has not been illustrated in Figure 14. Similarly, splitting observed on northern Washington may also be related to anisotropy from underlain Olympic slates as illustrated in Figure 14c. Figure 14c is based upon P -wave tomographic profiles across northern Washington [ Ramachandran et al. , 2006]. The variability of the terrane along with the mixed  degrees of deformation may be the cause of the complex anisotropy displayed by variations of with azimuth and incidence angle. The Eocene basalts that overlay the core rocks on southern Vancouver Island and northern Washington are isotropic and do not influence observations of anisotropy [ Christensen , 1966]. Whereas the Hurricane Ridge slate exhibits relatively weak anisotropy in comparison to Leech River Complex phyllites and schists, the extent of the core rocks is believed to be significantly greater than that of Leech River Complex rocks. We believe the core rocks may extend as far as the plate boundary. Using the veloc- ities stated earlier, Olympic slates could produce the 0.1Â­0.15 s of splitting typically observed in northern Washington with as little as 1Â­2 km for propagation perpendicular to the symmetry axis."

Summary We have conducted a splitting analysis using LFE templates distributed on southern Vancouver Island and northern Washington and presented the associated fast directions and delay times. Pervasively foliated and vertically dipping schists and phyllites in the Leech River Complex lead to anisotropy generated by a transversely isotropic medium with a symmetry axis in the horizontal plane. Anisotropy observed at the majority of stations can be readily explained by anisotropy resulting from preferred mineral orientation of rocks within the Leech River Complex. Anisotropic forward modeling using a north/northeast dipping Leech River Complex wedge model that exhibits horizontal transverse isotropy was able to reproduce trends in dominant fast directions, delay times, and, in select cases, azimuthal variations in fast direction. Crack anisotropy may provide an alternative explanation for anisotropy observed at stations that showed little relation to Leech River Complex properties; agreement with local estimates of maximum horizontal com- pressive stress was typically improved at these stations. Prior studies suggested that anisotropy observed at stations along southern Vancouver Island results from stress-aligned cracks, thus making them candi- dates to monitor local stress patterns [ Cassidy and Bostock , 1996; Currie et al. , 2001; Balfour et al. , 2012]. We have demonstrated that anisotropy at the same stations is equally well explained by preferred mineral ori- entation of the Leech River Complex thereby casting doubt on prior conclusions. Splitting observations on northern Washington appear to be due to a mixture of crack anisotropy and the preferred mineral orien- tation of anisotropic slates of the Olympic core rocks that underthrust local terranes. We suggest that the anisotropic slates of the Olympic core may extend beneath southern Vancouver Island and present an addi- tional source of anisotropy. If so, anisotropy due to the preferred mineral orientation of metamorphosed, accreted sedimentary rocks may be a global feature in forearc crusts of subduction zones."

Using geodetic data, Calais et al. [2010] and Hashimoto et al. [2011] attributed the slip to two asperities on a previously unmapped fault in the Leogane delta, north from the EPGF. Based on the analysis of geodetic, geologic and teleseismic observa- tions, Hayes et al. [2010] also inferred rupture primarily on the blind Leogane fault, with a minor contribution on the EPGF. One possible uncertainty about this event is the extent of its rupture in the offshore areas where it cannot be directly constrained by onland geodetic data. In par- ticular, this question became more of a concern after the identification of active offshore deformation by a marine geophysical survey and by the refined location of after- shocks derived from a combined temporary seismic net- work of 4 land and 21 ocean bottom stations (Haiti-OBS campaign) [ Mercier de LÃ©pinay et al. , 2011].

180 meng jgrb17044.pdf,M,Journal of Geophysical Research,"VNSN Data, Preprocessing, and Selection [ ] Our array backprojection study of the 2010 Haiti event 6 is based on data recorded at regional distance by the Vene- zuela National Seismic Network (VNSN). The VNSN is composed of 22 broadband stations, oriented mainly east- west, located approximately 9.5 degrees from Haiti in the perpendicular direction to the EPGF strike (Figure 1). The VNSN has a suitable geometrical configuration and location to study large earthquake ruptures in the Caribbean region. [ ] Array processing at regional distance aims at estimat- 7 ing the azimuth of arrival and relative timing of the seismic phases radiated from the strongest subevents of the earth- quake. The study of the 2010 Haiti earthquake remains challenging because of its compact source size, shorter than 40 km according to previous studies [ Calais et al. , 2010; Hayes et al. , 2010]. The resolution length scale along the fault that can be achieved with the standard beamforming techniques is evaluated by the array response function [ Rost and Thomas , 2002]. Figure 2 shows the array response of the VNSN and the USArray, the nearest array at teleseismic distance. The array responses are backprojected into the hypocentral region of the 2010 Haiti earthquake based on P travel times computed by the Tau-P toolkit and the IASP91 model [ Snoke , 2009]. The array response of VNSN is not isotropic. It has low resolution along the range direction (the source-to-array direction) but adequate cross-range resolu- tion (sub parallel to the fault strike in this case). In regional array processing, the range resolution is considerably poorer than the cross-range resolution, due to the small variability of the slowness of Pn waves as a function of epicentral distance. Hence, we compute the maximum of the array analysis result along lines parallel to the major axis of the array response pattern. Then these maxima are mapped onto the fault trace and plotted as a function of along strike position. The along-strike resolution length achieved by the USArray is approximately twice of that of the VNSN due to its more distant location and its more unfavorable orientation with respect to the fault strike. We note that the array response provides an ideal estimate of the array resolution. In practice, resolution is further affected by waveform incoherence and interference, as discussed through synthetic tests in section 3.2. Thus, to achieve adequate imaging of the Haiti earthquake the backprojection requires data from an array at regional distance. Moreover, since previous studies [ Hayes et al. , 2010; Calais et al. , 2010] indicate that the rupture length of the Haiti earthquake is as compact as 40 km, the analysis requires an array processing technique that can achieve higher resolution than standard beamforming. [ ] The Pn waveforms recorded by the VNSN are filtered 8 between 0.2 and 0.7 Hz. The low-frequency cutoff is dic- tated by a time-frequency trade-off (see section 3.1). The high-frequency cutoff is determined by the coherency of the array data, which is ultimately determined by the spacing between stations. The dominant frequency of the Pn waves is about 0.4 Hz. We align the waveforms on their first arrival by multichannel alignment [ Vandecar and Crosson , 1990] based on cross correlation of 10 s long windows containing c(""Figure 1."", ""Haiti earthquake recorded by the Venezuela National Seismic Network (VNSN).

The stations are reordered by a clustering algorithm. The black box encom- passes the most mutually coherent subset of stations, which is used in our array analysis. the first Pn arrivals. This procedure reduces the effect of travel time errors due to uncertainties in the velocity struc- ture [e.g., Ishii et al. , 2005]. [ ] Array processing techniques assume coherent signals 9 across the array. We select a subset of 13 stations with adequate waveform coherency by inspecting the array data coherence matrix. This matrix is made of the coherence between all pairs of stations computed during the multi- channel alignment procedure. The indices of the matrix are reordered to group together the most mutually coherent sta- Â­ tions (Figure 3). We found a modified k nearest neighbors clustering algorithm (www.eigenvector.com/MATLAB/ Mac_Mfiles/corrmap.m) to be adequate for this purpose. After inspection of the reordered matrix we select a subset of 13 stations that consistently have correlation coefficients larger than 0.8 (Figure 3). for Regional Arrays 3.1. Outline of the Method and Parameter Settings [ ] Here, we apply at regional distance a high-resolution 10 array analysis technique originally developed for a tele- seismic array study [ Meng et al. , 2011]. The method com- bines the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) array processing technique [ Schmidt , 1986; Goldstein and Archuleta , 1991; Guilbert et al. , 2005] with multitaper cross-spectrum estimation [ Thomson , 1982]. MUSIC was designed for high-resolution direction of arrival estimation of long and stationary signals [ Krim and Viberg , 1996]. The Pn phase is relatively stationary. The multitaper method yields a robust estimate of the data coherence matrix on relatively short time window and thus improves significantly the temporal resolution of MUSIC. Here we only describe the choice of processing parameters for this particular study. 4of 16 B04313 More details about the method are described by Meng et al. [2011]. 3.1.1. Number of Tapers in Cross-Spectrum Estimation [ ] The multitaper technique [ Thomson , 1982] averages 11 multiple, almost independent cross-spectral estimates obtained after tapering the data by a sequence of orthogonal functions with optimal temporal and spectral concentration. These Slepian tapers are the set of functions of finite tem- poral duration T with maximum energy within the band of frequencies lower than the bandwidth W. Given a time window duration T and a frequency bandwidth W, the Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã€ proper number of tapers is 2 T W 1. As a compro- Ã‚ mise between useful averaging (large T W) and adequate temporal resolution (short T) we use here 3 tapers, which Ã‚ implies T W= 2. 3.1.2. Length of Analysis Window [ ] The MUSIC method requires narrow band estimates 12 of cross spectrum, i.e., the bandwidth W (the frequency smearing of the spectral estimator) has to be small compared  to any frequency of analysis, W f. This implies a trade-off Ã‚ between temporal resolution and frequency localization: T  f 2 for 3 tapers. As a compromise here we set T = 30 s, Ã‚ which satisfies T f &gt; 6 for frequencies higher than 0.2 Hz.  At the dominant frequency of our data, f 0.4 Hz, we get Ã‚  T f 12. 3.1.3. Number of Principal Eigenvalues [ ] In MUSIC the signal subspace is defined as the sub- 13 space spanned by the distinctly largest eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix. Its complement defines the noise subspace. For stationary signals, the dimension N of the signal subspace is equal to the number of signal sources contributing to the data time window. In the case of transient seismic signals analyzed with relatively short time windows, each covariance matrix estimated with a separate taper tends to have only one nonzero eigenvalue and the associated eigenvectors tend to be independent. Hence, the rank of the covariance matrix obtained by linear combination of the multiple taper estimates tends to be equal to the number of tapers. In particular, the number of significant eigenvalues is at most three when using three tapers. Figure 4 shows results of the MUSIC analysis of the 2010 Haiti earthquake at 0.4 Hz, the dominant frequency of the seismograms, with N ranging from 1 to 4. The MUSIC pseudospectrum, a measure of the orthogonality between the array steering vector associated to a candidate source location and the noise subspace (for details, see Meng et al. [2011]), is plotted as a function of along-strike position with respect to the hypocenter and as a function of end time of the sliding windows. The MUSIC pseudospectrum is normal- ized by its maximum in each time window. Its amplitude depends on signal power, coherence and interference but it does not directly represent any physical quantity. Never- theless, the sharp peaks of the MUSIC pseudospectrum indicate the location of signal sources. In the MUSIC anal- ysis of the Haiti earthquake, two main subevents (black dots in Figure 4b) are visible and their estimated locations are independent of the choice of N. However, when N is too small (N = 1) the analysis fails to resolve two simultaneous sources. It only indicates the strongest source in each time window. The results with N = 2 or 3 show stable features of the rupture process including simultaneous multiple sources. When N is larger than the number of nonzero eigenvalues c(""(e.g., N = 4), the signal subspace is contaminated by noise"", ""and the resulting image is not stable. While the spatial"", ""location of the subevents is independent of the choice of N,"", ""their estimated timing is not.

The first subevent is located approximately 5.4 km east from the hypocenter. This distance is obtained by fitting a constant location to the peak location of the first event measured after the estimated location is stabilized (t = 15 s) and before the second subvevent becomes dominant (t = 27 s). The second subevent is approximately 35.7 km further west (30.3 km west from the hypocenter) based on the peak locations of the second suvevent measured after t = 27 s. This complexity is absent in the results of our analysis of the M 5.9 aftershock (Figure 8) and hence is not due to path effects or other phases. The temporal evolution is better imaged by array processing at the peak frequency (0.4 Hz). In Figure 4b, bilateral propagation is observed starting around t = 10 s, when the last 10 s of the 30 s window contain the signal. The eastward front runs for about 10 km in about 3 s. The westward front shows a weaker MUSIC pseudospectra but its propagation can be consistently tracked over a distance of $  35 km and a duration of about 10 s (until t 20 s). The rupture speed of both fronts is similar and consistent with usual subshear rupture speeds, given the shear wave speed of 3.65 km/s at 10 km depth in the Haiti region [ Bassin et al. , 2000]. These estimated subevent locations are consistent with the array analysis at the peak frequency of 0.4 Hz (Figure 4), although for the sake of robustness, the average $ over frequency band 0.2 0.7 Hz (Figure 9) is presented as our main result. The observed features are also compatible with the USArray source time functions and finite fault inversions described in section 5. Comparison to Independent Observations [ ] Our study is the first example of earthquake source 20 imaging at regional distance with Pn waves for earthquakes of magnitude as low as 7. To build confidence in our results, we compare them here to other available observations. The complementarity between the different source analysis techniques provides an integrated view of the 2010 Haiti earthquake rupture process. 5.1. Source Time Functions at USArray [ ] The temporal separation between the two asperities is 21 independently estimated from apparent source time func- tions obtained through deconvolution of teleseismic data by ' theoretical Green s functions (Figure 10) [ Chu et al. , 2009]. We selected USArray stations with epicentral distances greater than 30 degrees to avoid complexities of the P waveform due to triplication in the upper mantle. We com- ' puted synthetic Green s function using the generalized ray theory [ Helmberger , 1983], the IASPEI91 1D global velocity model [ Kennett and Engdahl , 1991] with the upper 30 km adjusted to a 4 layer Haiti regional crust model [ Bassin et al. , 2000] and the CMT solution (www.globalcmt. org). The vertical component P waveforms and synthetic ' Green s functions are filtered from 0.01 to 1 Hz and deconvolved in the time domain with the iterative tech- nique of [ Kikuchi and Kanamori , 1982] and with the nonnegative least squares algorithm [ Lawson and Hanson , 1974]. Both deconvolution techniques yield consistent 11 of 16 B04313 results. To estimate the temporal separation between the subevents and its uncertainty, we considered 1000 stacks of randomly selected subsets containing 90% of the USArray stations. We measured the delay between the two prominent peaks in the stacked apparent source time func- tions. We allow a 5 s range when estimating the timing of the second peak. Although some of the individual curves are noisy and bumpy, the bootstrapped stacked curve is smooth and robust. The estimated delays have a Gaussian distribu- tion with mean t1 = 5 s and standard deviation 0.02 s (Figure 10). We associate these to the two subevents found by our array analysis. The deconvolution analysis also indicates that the second subevent accounts for approxi- mately one third of the total moment release, consistent with the multiple CMT solution of Nettles and Hjorleifsdottir [2010]. Their analysis also indicates that the second sube- vent has a thrust mechanism, in contrast to the near strike- slip mechanism of the first subevent. Nevertheless, at the azimuth of the USArray both mechanisms produce similar amplitudes and our choice to use the CMT solution to ' generate the Green s functions does not introduce a signif- icant bias. 5.2. Improved Finite Fault Model [ ] To evaluate how the results of the backprojection and 22 USArray analysis of the source time function relate to other data sets and integrate in the global description of the rup- ture, we perform a joint source inversion based on tele- seismic body waves and the various geodetic data available. [ ] As detailed in previous studies [ Calais et al. , 2010; 23 Hayes et al. , 2010; Hashimoto et al. , 2011], the campaign GPS measurements and InSAR data provide a very good coverage of the Leogane delta where the rupture started and indicate that the deformation in this area is best explained by a fault segment dipping NNW. In agreement with those  studies, we choose a fault strike of 254 and a dip angle of  55 . This orientation of the fault plane is also compatible  with the alignment of aftershocks along a 75 N azimuth [ Mercier de LÃ©pinay et al. , 2011]. InSAR fringes (ALOS ascending track 137) and field measurements of the coastal vertical uplift in the area near the town of Petit Goave [ Hayes et al. , 2010] suggest the earthquake also extended west and offshore of the Leogane delta. This hypothesis is supported by the aftershock catalog obtained from the Haiti- OBS local network of terrestrial and ocean bottom seismic stations [ Mercier de LÃ©pinay et al. , 2011]. In contrast with previous models, we do not cover this offshore area by simply extending the preferred Leogane fault geometry (i.e., dipping NNW) to the west, but refine the model with a  distinct second fault segment dipping 45 to the NNE (strike  N275 ). This NNW to NNE rotation in the fault strike is supported by the moment tensors of the aftershocks [ Nettles and Hjorleifsdottir , 2010] and by the identification of bathymetric features with a similar orientation, such as the Trois Baies fault and the Transhaitian belt [ Mercier de LÃ©pinay et al. , 2011]. [ ] The location of the NEIC epicenter is incompatible 24 with our first fault segment as it would imply a very super- $ ficial rupture initiation ( 2 km), and would not be compat- ible in term of depth: the NEIC depth is fixed to 13 km by their location program.

The Rupture Speed [ ] The rupture speed can be reliably constrained by the 28 apparent subevent delay of t = 5 s and by the spatial 1 subevent separation of 21 km between the two subevents centroids provided by our geodetic-only slip inversion in Figure S7. Considering a bilateral rupture, the real inter- q Ã€ q subevent time delay is t = t + cos ( L L )/ c , where 0 1 w e is the angle between the fault strike and the source-to- array direction (40 degrees), c is the apparent P wave speed (12 km/s at epicentral distance of 40 degrees), L and L are w e the distances of the centroid of the westward and eastward subevents, respectively (L =21 km and L = 0 km). This w e yields a true intersubevent time of 6.3 s. The implied rupture speed, 3.3 km/s, is within the usual subshear range. For ref- erence the shear wave speed is 3.65 km/s at 10 km depth in the Haiti region [ Bassin et al. , 2000]. Although our regional array backprojection analysis currently has large uncertain- ties on the rupture timing (see section 3.1), our back- projection result at the dominant frequency, 0.4 Hz (Figure 4b), is consistent with this subshear rupture speed. 6.2. Spatial Complementarity Between High- and Low-Frequency Source Properties [ ] The primary results from the array analysis, the finite 29 fault inversion and the source time function analysis suggest that the rupture propagates bilaterally with primary west- ward rupture and minor eastward component, breaking two main slip patches. In the finite fault inversion, dominated by frequencies lower than 0.2 Hz, the first asperity is located near the epicenter and the second one is 21 km west and contributes to one third of the total seismic moment. On the other hand, the higher-frequency radiators imaged by the Â­ array analysis (0.2 0.7 Hz) suggest a distance of 35 km between the two asperities. [ ] Since the backprojection provides subevents locations 30 relative to the hypocenter, the choice of epicenter is essential in interpreting the result of the array processing. Assuming the epicenter given by NEIC, the subevent locations are consistent with the spatial pattern of the aftershocks (NEIC catalog), which cluster into two groups. The eastern group is close to the main shock epicenter and the second group is located 30 to 40 km west. If we assume the NEIC hypo- center, the western subevent is well beyond the high slip patches derived from the finite fault model, implying pos- sible slip further west offshore, unconstrained by geodesy. However, if we take the hypocenter adjusted by Mercier de LÃ©pinay et al. [2011] using local data instead of the NEIC location, the two HF subevents coincide with the terminal edges of the large slip areas. If we use the original NEIC hypocenter, the difference of the HF event and the peak slip zone is less obvious for the eastern asperity but still holds for the western asperity. This type of spatial complementarity between high- and low-frequency source properties was inferred for several other earthquakes, including the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the 1993 Kushiro-Oki earthquake [ Nakahara , 2008] and the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake [ Ide et al. , 2011; Meng et al. , 2011; Simons et al. , 2011]. This 14 of 16 B04313 complementarity can be interpreted as high-frequency radi- ation generated by the stopping phases, associated with abrupt rupture speed reduction at the edge of the slip area. This mechanism of high-frequency radiation was first described in circular crack models [ Madariaga , 1977, 1983] and was explained for general rupture front geometries through isochrone theory [ Bernard and Madariaga , 1984; Spudich and Frazer , 1984]. This interpretation is also con- sistent with the aftershock locations clustering at the regions of stress concentration at the edges of the coseismic rupture. "" """" Although the stopping phase interpretation is plausible for this particular earthquake, the generalization to other earthquakes is not warranted. Regardless of the mechanical origin of the high-frequency radiation, the backprojection analysis indicates its location. This is of practical importance for earthquake damage assessment. Note that the high-fre- quency radiation is absent at the western end of the first asperity, implying a smoother stopping or rupture transition without stopping between the two asperities. 6.3. Extent of the Offshore Rupture [ ] One aspect of the 2010 Haiti earthquake which still 31 remains to be elucidated is the extent to which the rupture propagated offshore. Previous studies did infer offshore faulting [ Calais et al. , 2010; Hayes et al. , 2010; Hashimoto et al. , 2011; Mercier de LÃ©pinay et al. , 2011] but these ' models didn t use all the now available data sets to constrain the slip extent and/or the fault geometry onto which slip should be projected. Taking into account all these data, we investigate the possibility that the rupture extended further offshore than previously thought. In particular, observations in the offshore region are suggestive of rupture extending further west than previously published source models. Marine seismic reflection profiles indicate the existence of a large-scale active anticline associated with the Trois Baies fault and the Transhaitian belt [ Mercier de LÃ©pinay et al. , 2011]. The aftershock locations derived from the Haiti- OBS campaign are offset by about 20 km NE relative to the NEIC catalog locations [ Mercier de LÃ©pinay et al. , 2011], implying that the western aftershock cluster is not onland but offshore. The Haiti-OBS catalog also confirms the existence of a cluster of aftershocks more than 30 km west of the Â­ epicenter, 10 20 km beyond the western end of coseismc slip of previous source models. [ ] While there is no direct offshore geodetic measure- 32 ments to constrain the western end of the rupture, InSAR and GPS data cannot be properly explained by onland faulting alone. GPS station LEOG strongly points offshore and west of the Leogane delta (Figure 11) despite the exis- tence of an asperity east of that point (this asperity is directly visible in the descending InSAR track 447). The dense InSAR fringes of acending track 137 (Figure S4) surround the coastline pointing to deformation in the center of the bay. [ ] In our kinematic source inversion based on tele- 33 seismic and geodetic data, slip is allowed to spread over more than 45 km west of the hypocenter (=maximum source Ã‚ Ã‚ duration maximum rupture speed = 15 3 km). However, in the resulting model the slip remains confined to less than 22 km west of the epicenter. We obtained a similar slip distribution in a finite fault inversion based only on the static data sets, InSAR and GPS (Figures S7 and S8) without constraint on the seismic moment, with comparable fit to MENG ET AL.: THE 2010 HAITI EARTHQUAKE B04313 the data (Figures S9 and S10) and with a seismic +19 moment (5.0 10 N m) very close to the CMT solu- +19 tion (4.7 10 N m). Moreover, the InSAR fringes along the coast (tracks A138a and A447d in Figure S10) tend to rotate slightly perpendicular to western end of our slip model, which suggests that there are no regions with larger slip further west. [ ] In summary, several arguments indicate that our pre- 34 ferred slip model did not miss any significant offshore deformation to the west. This result is consistent with the previously published models even though those models relied on different fault geometries. The spatial resolution of our regional backprojection is too coarse in the source-to- array direction (NNW-SSE) to provide an independent constraint on the distance between the coast and the second high-frequency source. However, the position of this second source along the cross-range direction (subparallel to the EPGF strike) is well constrained and is shown here to be consistent with the western end of offshore slip inferred from static deformation. This supports the idea that back- projection source imaging can identify the end tips of a rupture. 6.4. Advantage of Regional Array Backprojection for Earthquake Source Studies [ ] Our study of the 2010 Haiti earthquake demonstrates 35 that backprojection of P waves recorded at regional dis- tances can reveal the location of high-frequency source radiation that are not resolvable by finite source inversions at teleseismic distance, which are now common practice. This new capability, improved by our analysis procedure com- bining multitaper and MUSIC techniques, allows to study the rupture of earthquakes with magnitude as low as 7 pro- viding reliable spatial constraints. The approach requires that the approximate strike of the fault is known, but this infor- mation can usually be reliably extracted from the focal mechanism of the event. This implies that regional back- projection will be critical in the study of earthquakes when geodetic coverage is incomplete or local seismic networks are lacking, for instance in subduction zones. Moreover, the procedure can be automated for rapid, possibly real-time, earthquake analysis, combining the fault strike information from fast moment tensor inversions. In that sense, the VNSN alone has a great potential for the analysis of earthquake Â­ hazard for the whole Caribbean North America plate boundary. The high-frequency aspects of the source process derived from array backprojection are particularly useful to estimate potential damage in regions where the vulnerable components of the building stock are dominated by low rise (short period) buildings. In a more global perspective, the statistical analysis of the last 120 years of earthquakes dem- onstrate that most of the devastating earthquakes occur in continental interiors on previously unmapped faults [ England and Jackson , 2011]. Thus, with the ongoing development of regional seismic networks, many of those devastating earth- quakes will still happen at regional distance from networks, and require the resolving power of regional backprojection."
180 meng jgrb17044.pdf,C,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Conclusions [ ] In this study, we developed a backprojection source 36 imaging technique for body waves recorded by seismic 15 of 16 B04313 arrays at regional distances ( Pn waves). The technique combines the Multiple Source Classification (MUSIC) method with multitaper cross-spectral estimation to achieve sharper source imaging than existing methods. This tech- nique allowed us to extract key aspects of the rupture pro- cess of the 2010 Haiti earthquake from recordings by the Venezuela National Seismic Network (VNSN). In particular, it provides the locations of high-frequency source radiation. When integrated with independent studies based on tele- seismic and geodetic data of this earthquake, our results indicate bilateral rupture at subshear speed, with a much longer rupture segment toward the West. Prominent high- frequency radiation originates from rupture arrest phases at the tip of the main slip areas. Additional rupture offshore is not supported by our analysis. Our results demonstrate how regional array studies can contribute to the characterization of seismic sources in the Caribbean region and elsewhere, particularly in offshore regions where local seismic network or geodetic data coverage are not available, with potential application for rapid earthquake response.

Surface wave dispersion measurements from ambient seismic noise and array [ ] 1 measurements from teleseismic earthquakes observed with the EarthScope/USArray Transportable Array (TA) are inverted using a Monte Carlo method for a 3 the crust and uppermost mantle beneath the western United States. The combination of data from these methods produces exceptionally broadband dispersion information from 6 to 100 s period, which constrains shear wave velocity structures in the crust and uppermost mantle to a depth of more than 100 km. The high lateral resolution produced by the TA network and the broadbandedness of the dispersion information motivate the  question of the appropriate parameterization for a 3 D model, particularly for the crustal part of the model. We show that a relatively simple model in which monotonically with depth in the crust can fit the data well across more than 90% of the study region, except in eight discrete areas where greater crustal complexity apparently exists. The regions of greater crustal complexity are the Olympic Peninsula, the MendocinoTriple Junction, the Yakima Fold Belt, the southern Cascadia back arc, the Great Central Valley of California, the Salton Trough, the Snake River Plain, and the Wasatch Mountains. We also show that a strong Rayleigh much of the western United States, which can be resolved by introducing radial anisotropy in both the mantle and notably the crust. We focus our analysis on demonstrating the existence of crustal radial anisotropy and primarily discuss the crustal part of the isotropic model that results from the radially anisotropic model by Voigt averaging. Model uncertainties from the Monte Carlo inversion are used to identify robust isotropic features in the model. The uppermost mantle beneath the western United States is principally  composed of four large scale shear wave velocity features, but lower crustal velocity structure exhibits far greater heterogeneity. We argue that these lower crustal structures are predominantly caused by interactions with the uppermost mantle, including the intrusion and underplating of mafic mantle materials and the thermal depression of wave speeds caused by conductive heating from the mantle. Upper and middle crustal wave speeds are generally correlated, and notable anomalies are inferred to result from terrane accretion at the continental margin and volcanic intrusions.  Moschetti, M.

S However, this work was completed before the TA was deployed in the western United States and the corresponding resolution is lower than what now can be achieved. Yang et al. [2008b] inverted Rayleigh wave phase speed mea- surements from ANT and MPWT for a V model of the SV crust and upper mantle in the western United States, but this study did not include Love waves and the model did not account for the crustal and uppermost mantle radial anisot-  ropy ( V V ) that has been documented, for example, by SH SV Nettles and Dziewonski [2008], Bensen et al. [2009], and Moschetti et al. [2010]. Inversions of Rayleigh wave data alone cannot untangle shear wave velocity perturbations caused by radial anisotropy from those caused by isotropic wave speed anomalies. In addition to Love and Rayleigh wave phase speed measurements, we incorporate here Rayleigh wave group speed data from ANT. Group speed measurements have shallower depth sensitivity than phase speed measurements at the same period and provide addi- tional constraints on crustal velocity structure. [ ] We seek here, in particular, to identify a single 5 parameterization, particularly of the crust, that can be applied across the entire western United States except perhaps at isolated locations of greater complexity. We doc- ument how across most of the western United States crustal wave speeds can be considered to increase monotonically  with depth (thus crustal low velocity zones generally are not required by the data), but crustal and upper mantle radial anisotropy is needed to fit Rayleigh and Love wave dis- persion data simultaneously. Our discussion is focused,  however, on the isotropic component of the 3 D radially anisotropic V model. The isotropic model presented here is S constructed by Voigt averaging the V and V models that SH SV result from the radially anisotropic inversion. Discussion and interpretation of the radial anisotropy is the subject of Moschetti et al. [2010]."
188 moschetti jgrb16522.pdf,M,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Methods [ ] The inversion of surface wave dispersion measure- 6  ments for a 3 D V model is carried out in two steps. The S first step, termed surface wave tomography, is the inversion for Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion maps. This step is described by Moschetti et al. [2007], Lin et al. [2008], and Yang et al. [2008b]. The second step, which we carry out here, is inversion of the surface wave dispersion maps for a  3 D V model. Here, we use a Monte Carlo method to infer S a radially anisotropic V model of the crust and uppermost S mantle beneath the western United States, referred to as model m . We calculate the isotropic component of this 1 model by Voigt averaging. For comparison, we also carry out the direct inversion for an isotropic model called m . 0 Because we employ a Monte Carlo inversion scheme, the V S structure beneath each grid point is represented by a set of models that fit the data similarly well, which provides uncertainty estimates used to identify robust model features. 2.1.

However, the observed Rayleigh wave phase speeds are slower than  model predicted phase speeds in the Yakima Fold Belt (Figure 16d) and Great Central Valley (Figure 16e). The Rayleigh wave group speeds below about 15 s period are  generally slow relative to the model predicted values except in the Mendocino Triple Junction (Figure 16a), Olympic  Peninsula (Figure 16b), and southern Cascadia back arc (Figure 16c) regions where the Rayleigh wave group speeds contain local maxima below 20 s period that are not well fit by the final V model. The Love wave phase speeds below S 15 s period are notably fast, relative to the data for the Olympic Peninsula (Figure 16b), southern Cascadia back arc  (Figure 16c) and Snake River Plain (Figure 16g). Model predicted Love wave phase speeds are slow at these periods in the Great Central Valley (Figure 16e) and Wasatch Range (Figure 16h). Although the V model allows for radial S anisotropy in the middle and lower crust, we note that a  Rayleigh Love discrepancy remains in the data misfits from the Yakima Fold Belt and the Wasatch Range (Figures 16d and 16h). [ ] We identify two general classes of data misfit in the 42 characteristic data misfit plots in Figure 16. [ ] 1. The first class of structure is at grid points where 43 data misfit is greatest at short periods (&lt;15 s) and increases with decreasing period. Because misfit occurs primarily at the shortest periods, where the dispersion curves are most sensitive to the shallowest velocity structures, the model parameterization in the upper and middle crust needs to be modified. Data misfits from the Yakima Fold Belt, Great Central Valley, Snake River Plain, and Wasatch Range belong to this class. [ ] 2. The second class of structure is at grid points 44 Â­ where data misfits are greatest at intermediate periods (15 30 s), including the data misfits from the Mendocino Triple  Junction, Olympic Peninsula, southern Cascadia back arc, and Salton Trough regions. In these cases, the models underpredict the Rayleigh wave group speeds between about 10 and 15 s period. For the first three regions listed, this misfit characteristic in the Rayleigh wave group speeds coincides with minima in the group speed curves at longer periods (&gt;25 s). This intermediate period Airy phase may indicate a small to negative gradient in the V depth profile S  and suggests that crustal low velocity zone parameteriza- tions may be needed. In the Salton Trough region, the shortest (&lt;10 s) and longer (&gt;25 s) periods are well fit, but the intermediate periods are slow for all wave types. Alter- native midcrustal model parameterizations may be more appropriate for this region.

Anomalous Misfit Regions [ ] Although 90% of the study region is fit by a simple 53 V model of the crust and uppermost mantle, high data S misfits remain at 10% of the model grid points. The grid points with significant misfit at the short periods consistent with a crustal origin can be organized into eight geologic regions: (1) the Olympic Peninsula, (2) Mendocino Triple Junction, (3) southern Cascadia back arc and High Lava Plains, (4) Yakima Fold Belt, (5) Salton Trough, (6) Snake River Plain, (7) California Great Central Valley, and (8) Wasatch Range. Because these regions are geologically complex and the current model parameterization is not able to fit the observed data well, further investigation into the V structure S of these regions is required. [ ] We suggest three modifications to the current model 54 parameterization to improve the data misfit from these regions: (1) breaking the constraint that crustal shear wave velocities increase monotonically with depth, (2) introduc- ing thinner crustal layers, and (3) including the effect of ' radial anisotropy in the upper crust. Except in California s Great Central Valley, where sediment thicknesses are sig- nificantly greater than average, sensitivity tests suggest that perturbations to the V structure of the sediment layer are S unlikely to resolve the observed data misfits. The first data misfit class, defined in section 3.3, is likely to show improved fit to the data by modifying the parameterization of the upper to middle crustal layers. In contrast, the second data misfit class is likely to be improved by varying model parameterization at the depths of the middle and lower crustal layers. Moschetti and Ritzwoller (manuscript in c 2 preparation, 2010) examine the effect on misfit of breaking the monotonic crustal velocity constraint within the   Cascadia fore arc, arc and back arc regions and find that the misfit to the dispersion data from the Cascadia fore arc beneath northern California is improved by the introduction  of a crustal low velocity zone."
188 moschetti jgrb16522.pdf,C,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Conclusions [ ] A radially anisotropic inversion of Rayleigh and 55 Love wave dispersion measurements from Ambient Noise Tomography (ANT) and Multiple Plane Wave Tomography  (MPWT) is carried out to construct an isotropic 3 D V S model of the crust and uppermost mantle beneath the western United States. Because the data are inverted by a Monte Carlo method, model uncertainties accompany the model and allow for the identification of persistent model features by statistical hypothesis testing. Model uncertainties peak below the Moho and reduce confidence in the upper- most mantle V estimates from the base of the crust to about S 55 km depth, but persistent isotropic anomalies exist at all crustal depths across the western United States. [ ] Although the velocity structure of the upper mantle 56 beneath the western United States consists of only four  principal large scale shear wave velocity features, the overlying continental crust contains far greater heterogene- ity. We infer that the high wave speed anomalies of the lower crust result primarily from mafic compositions caused  by intrusion, under plating or accretion. The low wave 18 of 20 B10306 speed anomalies of the lower crust beneath the Basin and Range, High Lava Plains and eastern California are inferred to be thermally depressed wave speed features caused by conductive heating. At middle crustal depths, accretionary prisms and mÃ©lange show the lowest wave speeds. Middle crustal high wave speed anomalies are caused by both com- positional effects, for example, the basalts of the Columbia River flood basalt group and throughout the Snake River Plain, and crystalline effects, as seen in the granitoids of the Sierra Nevada. In general, the upper and middle crustal wave speed anomalies are correlated. Prominent exceptions to this correlation include the Snake River Plain, Northern Rocky Mountains and eastern Basin and Range. The velocity structure of the middle and lower crust beneath the Snake River Plain is consistent with a mafic intrusion caused by the passing Yellowstone hot spot. The cause of the wave speed differences in the upper and middle to lower crust beneath the Northern Rocky Mountains and the Basin and Â­ Range (Figures 10a 10c) remains enigmatic. The ampli- tudes of the observed velocity anomalies are similar to the amplitudes of radial anisotropy for the crust and uppermost mantle found by Moschetti et al. [2010], so that radial anisotropy cannot be ignored in the construction of an iso- tropic V model either in the crust or upper mantle. S [ ] The vast majority (90%) of the western United States 57 is well fit by a radially anisotropic V model with the S parameterization discussed in section 2.2.1 where crustal velocities increase monotonically with depth. However, this simple model parameterization is not sufficient to fit all dispersion curves in the western United States, and high crustal misfit is observed in the Olympic Peninsula, Men- docino Triple Junction, southern Cascadia back arc, Yakima Fold Belt, Salton Trough, Snake River Plain, California Great Central Valley, and Wasatch Range. Future work is needed to investigate the effect of different crustal para- meterizations on data misfit in these regions. The inversion method presented here naturally lends itself to the incor-  poration of longer period (&gt;32 s) Love wave measurements for improved constraints on mantle radial anisotropy and to the inversion of emerging data from the TA to extend the model to a continental scale crustal V model.

Introduction Crustal models such as CRUST5.1 [ Mooney et al. , 1998], 3SMAC [ Nataf and Ricard , 1996], and CRUST2.0 [ Bassin et al. , 2000] have proven very useful in the seismological and broader geophysical community. These models have generally been constructed using a combination of empirical results along with other approaches fi developed to ll in gaps where the models lacked observations. One such method is geophysical analogy which estimates structure in regions without data by comparison to regions with similar geology and tectonic history that do have data. They seem to be particularly useful in global tomography where it is desirable to remove the contaminating effect of the crust in order to better image the underlying mantle. They have also proven handy as starting models for smaller-scale crustal studies where coverage is very uneven and in studies for which it is necessary to have a reasonable understanding of Earth structure outside the immediate study area. Finally, reference crustal models are often seen as a repository for collective community knowledge and are useful as a benchmark in comparisons with data-driven models. Over the years, however, as sampling of many regions has improved and new regions have been explored, a fi number of problems with these models have been identi ed. First, initial versions of the crustal models, which were parameterized on a 5Â° grid, were generally found to be too coarse for meaningful use in regional fi studies. Resampled models such as CRUST2.0 [ Bassin et al. , 2000], which is de ned on a 2Â° grid, were developed, fi though still averaging structure known on a ner scale such as models of ice and sediment cover [e.g., Laske and Masters , 1997]. fi Second, the quality of the crustal thickness representation in the models was uneven, being signi cantly better in regions with point constraints than in regions where the crustal thickness was based on geophysical extrapolation. Similarly, the upper mantle was limited in several ways. In some models, such as CRUST5.1 and CRUST2.0, the uppermost mantle below the Moho was only crudely represented, being inconsistent with fi results from Pn and Sn tomography. And the structure beneath, de ning the complete lithospheric lid and underlying asthenosphere, were not represented at all. fi Based on these ndings, we have developed a new model that expands on the successes of CRUST5.1 and fi similar models and attempts to improve where the model was found to be de cient. One general approach c(""to the update is to incorporate more types of data in order to replace extrapolated portions of the model with"", ""a more data-driven approach. In this study, we update this model in three key ways: reparameterization,"", ""updated crustal structure, including an updated crustal thickness map, and a newly developed uppermost"", ""mantle to produce the LITHO1.0 model. The model is then driven by"", ""fi"", ""ts to a high-resolution surface wave"", ""data set. We expect that, with these changes, this model of the crust and lithospheric mantle will continue to"", 
""be useful and relevant to the broader community."", ""Finally, we are not naive enough to think that we know the complicated lithospheric structure of the Earth"", ""everywhere at both high lateral and vertical resolution. What we are aiming for is a consistent, defensible,"", ""and updatable model that is compatible with observed data and can capture some of the geophysical"", ""community"", ""'"", ""s collective understanding of the Earth. As such, we lay out the details of how the models are"", ""built, rather than dwelling on the speci"",

Our basic philosophy is to test a large series of"", ""models that are perturbations of a starting model which is consistent with a range of given information about"", ""crust and upper mantle structure (e.g., tectonic regions, crustal thickness from receiver functions and other"", ""information, upper mantle velocities from traveltime models, and thermotectonic information).

204 pasyanos jgrb50576.pdf,M,Journal of Geophysical Research,"2. Parameterization The goal of this study is to produce a global model (Figure 1) which requires a parameterization suitable for geophysical computations on a sphere. Lateral fi parameterization of the model is de ned with a spherical tessellation surface, while depth parameterization is achieved through the thickness and associated parameters (density, V , V , Q ) of layers. p s We decided to parameterize the model laterally as a tessellated surface, rather fi than on a xed grid of latitude and longitude, because it more evenly samples the globe. The icosahedron tessellation parameterization used here is well established in other applications such as mantle convection simulations [ Baumgardner and Frederickson , 1985], fi magnetic eld modeling [ Constable et al. , 1993], and seismic modeling [ Wang and Dahlen , 1995; Sambridge and Faletic , 2003; Ballard et al. , 2009]. We use the same grid as in Simmons et al. [2012]. We have increased the nominal lateral resolution relative to previous models (CRUST5.1 and CRUST2.0), and there is an average distance of about 1Â° between tessellation fi points. The tessellation is created by rst constructing an icosahedron: a regular polyhedron with 20 equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices, which are approximately 60Â° apart. Each triangle is then subdivided into four daughter triangles, halving the node separation each time and repeated until we reach the Figure 2. Lateral parameterization shown by maps for level 7 (~1Â°) tes- desired spacing. With six subdivisions sellation on the global and regional scales. Points indicate nodes, while     (60Â° 30Â°, 30Â° 15Â°, 15Â° 8Â°, 8Â° 4Â°, red lines connect nearest nodes.   4Â° 2Â°, 2Â° 1Â°) of the starting object we have 40,962 vertices and 81,920 triangles at approximately 1Â° resolution. In comparison, a 1Â° regular grid in latitude and longitude would have fi signi cantly more points (64,800) but more closely sampled at the poles, whereas tessellated nodes are evenly distributed. An example of the tessellated nodes on global and regional scales is shown in Figure 2. fi Compared to CRUST5.1 and CRUST2.0, the depth parameterization of the model was modi ed in several ways. First, an additional sediment layer was added to allow the easier inclusion, and more adequate representation, of an updated version of the sediment model [ Laske and Masters , 1997]. This is needed because the properties of sediments in the deepest sedimentary basins (estimated to be up to 21 km in the ' North Caspian) are quite different from the properties of sediments near the Earth s surface. Second, in the mantle, an additional layer was added to represent the thickness and velocity of the lithospheric lid overlying an asthenospheric mantle. The new layer structure is shown in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 3. Each layer fi has a thickness and associated parameters such as velocity ( V and V ), density, and Q . Unmodi ed p s parameters relative to the starting model (see below for details) are indicated by parentheses in Table 1. The Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2013JB010626 a Table 1. Layer Structure of the LITHO1.0 Model a fi Parameters unmodi ed from the starting model are shown in parentheses. asthenosphere then transitions into the ak135 model [ Kennett et al. , 1995]. Although the lithosphere- asthenosphere boundary (LAB) is plotted as a sharp feature in Figure 3, we would not necessarily expect this boundary to be so. However, as discussed extensively in Pasyanos [2010], the sharpness of this discontinuity has no effect on the long-period surface waves which are instead sensitive to the overall depth of the trend to lower shear-wave velocities in the asthenosphere. The lithospheric lid and hence the total lithospheric fi thickness is de ned as follows: the thickness of the high-velocity mantle layer underlying the crust and overlying a lower velocity layer fi (asthenosphere) that is required to t the surface wave data. This is a seismic lithospheric thickness, in contrast to other estimates of this parameter, such as thermal, electrical, chemical, or elastic lithospheric thickness [ Artemieva , 2011]. The lithosphere- asthenosphere boundary (LAB) depth is the fi interface between these two de ned layers. 3. Initial Model fi The rst step in our inversion is to build a starting model which is then perturbed to compile LITHO1.0. This is effectively our Bayesian prior. The initial model consists of the crust (including oceans, ice, and sediments) from the CRUST1.0 model [ Laske et al. , 2012] over an upper mantle velocity derived from the LLNL-G3D model [ Simmons et al. , 2012] and a lid thickness estimated from Pasyanos [2005]. Unlike CRUST2.0, the CRUST1.0 model includes an updated version fi Figure 3. Depth-velocity pro le showing model features. The crust of the full three-layer sediment model of is represented by three layers, and the sediments are represented Laske and Masters [1997]. It also includes an by up to three layers. The gray arrow indicates the lithosphere. updated crustal thickness map based on a M = Moho and LAB = lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2013JB010626 fi new database of crustal 1-D pro les from active source seismic studies as well as from receiver function studies. In areas where such constraints are still missing, such as Antarctica, crustal thicknesses were estimated using gravity constraints [e.g., Block et al. , 2009]. The crustal stack is placed over an upper mantle lid velocity from the LLNL-G3D model [ Simmons et al. , 2012]. This model was developed using about 3 million P and Pn arrivals and is designed to accurately predict seismic traveltimes at regional and teleseismic distances. The thickness of the lid layer and hence the overall lithospheric thickness is estimated from Pasyanos [2005]. In that study, a lithospheric thickness relation was fl developed by regressing long-period dispersion velocities to lithospheric thickness estimates from heat ow in the continents [ Artemieva , 2006] and lithospheric cooling in the oceans [ Turcotte and Schubert , 1982]. The fi Ã€ relationship is speci ed as z = 500 Ã— [max( U , 3.7) 3.6] Â± 40, where z is lithospheric thickness (in km) litho litho and U is the 80 s Rayleigh wave group velocity (in km/s). These layers then sit over an asthenosphere layer of constant thickness then transitioned into the ak135 model [ Kennett et al. , 1995]."
204 pasyanos jgrb50576.pdf,RD,Journal of Geophysical Research,"4. Suite of Tested Models After creating the initial model, we perturb a number of model parameters (crustal velocity, mantle velocity, crustal thickness, and lid thickness) to create a suite of about 10,000 models. The water, ice, and fi sediment structure is xed. The crustal velocities and densities of the whole crustal stack, and not any   individual layers, are perturbed by up to Â±5%. The crustal thickness is also varied by Â±1.5 where is an estimate of the standard deviation of our crustal thickness estimates. This is estimated to be 6 km for continental crust and 3 km for oceanic crust. These numbers are derived from the nugget (origin value) of the variogram (variance as a function of point separation) from the modeling of individual crustal thickness estimates. They are currently only differentiated for continental and oceanic crust,  Ã€    but could conceivably be laterally varying in the future. The idea of sampling from 1.5 to +1.5 ,   where and are the mean and standard deviation, allows us to cover about 90% of the samples of a normal distribution.  In the upper mantle, we perturb the lid velocity by Â±3% and lithospheric thickness is varied by Â±1.5 . We have  set here as 50 km, slightly higher than the standard deviation of our lithospheric thickness relationship, to fi fi account for its larger mis t for the greater thicknesses. In all cases, the V / V ratio is xed, either from values in p s   the sediments and crust in the CRUST1.0 model or set to be = 0.26 and = 0.29, respectively, in the lid and asthenosphere. Since attenuation also has an effect on surface wave dispersion, we have had to make reasonable estimates of Q . Taking the lead from the PREM (preliminary reference Earth model) [ Dziewonski and Anderson , 1981] and ak135 [ Kennett et al. , 1995] models, we specify values of 600 for the crust, from 250 to 400 in the mantle lid, and 70 in the asthenosphere. Depths where these Q values are in effect will depend &lt; on the inversion. Any nonphysical models (e.g., lithospheric thickness crustal thickness, crustal &lt; thickness sediment thickness) are not tested. The predicted surface wave dispersion for each of the models is calculated using the MINOS/MINEOS package (http://igppweb.ucsd.edu/~gabi/rem.dir/surface/minos.html; http://www.geodynamics.org/cig/ software/mineos) [ Woodhouse , 1988]. These packages compute surface wave dispersion for a spherically symmetric nonrotating Earth by summing normal modes. The calculated group and phase velocities are used to select from the proposed models. While we acknowledge that there is well-known radial and azimuthal anisotropy in the Earth [e.g., Debayle et al. , 2005; EkstrÃ¶m and Dziewonski , 1998], our initial goal is to develop an isotropic model that can be improved in the future to include anisotropy. The dispersion values predicted for each model are compared to the observed dispersion from our high-resolution global surface wave data set (Z. Ma and G. Masters, A new global Rayleigh and Love wave group velocity data set for constraining lithospheric properties, submitted to Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America , 2014; Z. Ma et al., A comprehensive dispersion model of surface wave phase and group velocity, fi submitted to Geophysical Journal International , 2014). We then select the model that best ts the observed dispersion data. 5. Surface Wave Data Sets and Surface Wave Model We assembled a surface wave data set by combining dispersion measurements from four groups: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [ Pasyanos , 2005], the University of Colorado [ Levshin and Ritzwoller , 2001], c(""Columbia University ["", ""EkstrÃ¶m"", "", 2011], and the"", ""University of California at San Diego (Ma and"", ""Masters, submitted manuscript, 2014; Ma"", ""et al., submitted manuscript, 2014).

Inversion Examples The inversion for structure at each node is perhaps best illustrated by example. Here we invert for a single node in Siberia (Figure 5). The basic method of inverting the dispersion results for layered Earth structure is the grid search method described in Pasyanos [2010]. As mentioned, we perform a grid search over four Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2013JB010626 parameters: crustal velocity perturbation, upper mantle velocity perturbation, crustal thickness, and lid thickness. Figure 5a shows V (red lines), V (green lines), and density (blue lines) where the starting model, p s constructed as described above, for all values is indicated by the black lines. Figure 5b shows the predicted dispersion curves for this same series of models. In this case, the colored symbols indicate the observed dispersion values for that node, while the colored lines show the range of dispersion predicted by the various models, where the starting model is again denoted by black lines. The range of models that we test cover the parameter space in both depth and dispersion, as indicated in Figure 5b. All of the models were compared, fi and we selected the one that has the lowest RMS mis t between the predicted and observed dispersion, fi fi scaled by the surface wave uncertainties as speci ed in the previous section. The nal model is shown in fi fi Figure 5c and the ts to the observed dispersion values in Figure 5d. For this node, we are able to t the surface waves with a faster crust, a slightly faster mantle, a thicker crust, and a thinner lithosphere. fi While, in general, we search for the best tting model, we view as acceptable all of the models that have RMS errors within the uncertainty of the surface wave model. We use the suite of acceptable models and calculate the statistics of these models to determine uncertainties on key parameters, such as crustal velocity, crustal thickness, upper mantle velocity, and lithospheric thickness. For this particular node, for example, we fi nd uncertainties of 0.05 km/s and 0.03 km/s for the average P wave and S wave crustal velocities, 2 km for the crustal thickness, 0.06 km/s and 0.03 km/s for the upper mantle P wave and S wave velocities, and about 30 km for the lithospheric thickness. fi A second example is shown for a node in oceanic crust from a region in the central Paci c. Here we see many of the same features, including the fact that the tested models cover a large region of the velocity-density model space, albeit for a more limited range of crustal thicknesses appropriate for oceanic crust (Figure 6a). Still, we see the models tested cover a large portion of the dispersion space (Figure 6b). It appears that the fi starting model ts the Love waves reasonably well but is generally too fast for the observed Rayleigh wave fi fi phase and group velocities. After the grid search, we nd that we are able to t the surface waves with a slower crust, a slightly faster mantle, a thicker crust, and a thinner lithospheric thickness (Figures 6c and 6d). 7. The LITHO1.0 Model Inversions like the examples shown above are performed independently at each node in our model. There is no inherent smoothness in the model other than that in the underlying surface wave dispersion maps. We then assemble the results and examine the evolution of key lithospheric parameters such as average crustal velocity, crustal thickness, upper mantle velocity, and lithospheric thickness relative to the starting model. We will then fi examine the model on a ner scale for a couple of regions. Figure 7 shows maps of the four parameters mentioned for the starting model, while Figure 8 shows the same parameters for the LITHO1.0 model. We examine them in turn. The average crustal compressional wave velocity, shown in Figures 7a and 8a, is estimated by taking the average V in the crystalline crust, that is, the p three crustal layers below the basement and not including ice, water, or sediment layers. The initial model, coming from the CRUST1.0 crustal velocities, only shows moderate variations ranging between 6.3 and fi 6.6 km/s in the continents and slightly higher in oceanic crust. After inversion, we nd much larger variations, especially between slow crustal velocities in tectonic areas, such as the Zagros and Tibet, and fast crustal fi velocities in older, colder crust. We also nd overall lower velocities in oceanic crust. By averaging all values fi across the globe, we nd that the overall average crustal velocity changes from 6.65 km/s to 6.55 km/s. Figures 7b and 8b are plots of crustal thickness. In the starting model, which is based on the updated crustal fi thickness maps, we can see the very large dichotomy between oceanic and continental crust and signi cantly thicker crust in areas such as the Tibetan Plateau. There are relatively small variations seen over broad regions of Africa and Eurasia. After inversion, we see a shift toward thicker crust over large portions of the model. The average crustal thickness overall changes from 19 km to 22 km. We also see, for example, that there are more variations within the continents than in the starting model, which is probably more realistic. Some of the fi overall shift to thicker crust, especially in the oceans, is probably an artifact created by tting both Love and Rayleigh waves with an isotropic model and is likely to be less of an effect in a radially anisotropic model. Figures 7c and 8c are plots of upper mantle compressional wave velocity, that is V in the uppermost mantle p fi or lid. It is sometimes referred to as Pn velocity since that is the velocity that this rst-arriving wave at regional c(""distances travels. This portion of the model comes from the uppermost mantle velocities from the LLNL-G3D"", ""model.

A comparison of lithospheric thickness for North America. (a) Lithospheric thickness in the region from the LITHO1.0 model at tessellation levels 3 through 7. (b) Lithospheric thickness from the study of Yuan and Romanowicz [2010]. We performed a similar comparison of lithospheric thickness estimates in Africa with the study of Priestley and Tilmann [2009]. In this study, the seismic velocity structure of the upper mantle is used to estimate temperature. Temperature, in turn, is used to estimate where the mode of heat transport changes from fi conduction to advection, which is then de ned as the base of the lithosphere. Comparisons of lithospheric thickness in Africa and Arabia show great similarity, not only in the location and depth of the major African cratons (Congo, Tanzania, Zambia, Kalahari, and West African cratons) but also in thicker lithosphere found along the Hellenic Arc and Zagros fold and thrust belt in both studies (Figure 12). fi It appears then that the method that we use to derive lithospheric thickness (primarily tting surface waves in our study) appears to be very consistent with other estimates of this parameter derived from other parameters as diverse as azimuthal anisotropy and seismically estimated temperature gradient. In the rest of this section, we highlight a few interesting features of the model (Figure 13) for the Greenland Shield, the Trans-European Suture Zone (TESZ), the Siberian Shield, and the Indo-Eurasian collision zone. fi The rst feature we highlight is the Greenland Shield (Figure 13a), which is part of the North American craton. The craton, however, is not a continuous feature, and Greenland is separated from the rest of the Canadian fi Shield by regions of thin lithosphere under Baf n Bay and Davis Strait. This feature, not often observed in low- resolution models or models that only estimate lithospheric thickness under continents, is a branch of extension from the opening of the North Atlantic. The second feature is the sharp contrast in lithospheric thickness across the TESZ (Figure 13b) separating the East European craton from the extended crust of western Europe from Denmark to the Black Sea. Note as well the Baltic Shield abutting against the thin lithosphere of the Caledonides orogeny in western Scandinavia. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2013JB010626 Figure 12.

This de nesthe plateboundarybetween theEurasia Plateand the North American Plate to the northeast, the Amur microplate to the south, and the Okhotsk microplate to the east. There is less of a contrast with the West Siberian Platform to the west. The last feature we highlight is the Indo-Eurasian collision zone (Figure 13d). Here we see the thick lithosphere of the Indian Plate contrasting with the moderately thickened Tibetan Plateau along the Himalayan orogeny, with adjacent tectonic regions having thin lithosphere.

Since we are constructing the model with prior information, however, this is not necessarily the case. An initial validation fi test, then, is to see how the inverted model does at tting the input surface wave data. Figure 14 shows an fi fi example of ts for Rayleigh waves at different periods, the rst being 20 mHz (50 s) phase velocities, and the second being 30 mHz (~33 s) group velocities. In each, Figure 14 (left) shows the velocities predicted by fi the starting model, as described above, Figure 14 (middle) shows the velocities of the nal inverted model, fi and Figure 14 (right) shows the data being t which, in this case, is the tomographic surface wave dispersion fi map. It is clear in all cases, including those not shown, that the LITHO1.0 model ts the surface wave data much better than the starting model. While we might reasonably expect the model to predict dispersion values that are used in its construction, we would not have the same expectation of surface wave data outside of the frequency band employed, which was not used in the construction of the model. Figure 15 is a comparison of predicted dispersion values (20 s Rayleigh wave group velocities) to a tomographic inversion of the same type [ Pasyanos , 2005]. To reiterate, none of these data were used to construct LITHO1.0 and are completely outside of the range of frequencies Â­ (5 40 mHz) used. As such, it represents an extrapolation of dispersion prediction to higher frequencies. What fi fi we nd, however, is that the t between the predicted dispersion and that independently derived from tomography is excellent."

Comparisons of the paleogeographic record with seismic tomography sections from [ ] 1 the mantle below Asia indicate that detached slab remnants associated with a range of ages since subduction spanning roughly 100 Myr appear to occupy mid-mantle depths at different sites. More than one explanation for the observed spectrum of ages at similar depths may be plausible. To identify key parameters controlling the sinking rate of a slab, we examine the effects of mantle viscosity, Rayleigh number, and spherical geometry, as well as the role of slab properties, such as strike width, depth extent at the time of slab detachment, and slab rheology. We model scenarios featuring detached mantle slabs in 3-D calculations and conclude that the initial depth extent of a subducted slab segment is a key parameter determining the rate at which the slab sinks. We estimate that stiff slabs are able to occupy mid-mantle depths for ages ranging from approximately 35 to 150 Myr, depending on the initial depth extent of the slab at the time of its detachment from the lithosphere. This age range results from the time that different slab fragments require to cross the viscosity interface at the upper mantle/lower mantle boundary. In cases featuring mature slabs where the lower section of the slab has penetrated the lower mantle prior to detachment, entrainment by the deep sinking segment helps the young upper mantle section of the slab cross into the lower mantle much more quickly than a slab segment initially confined to the upper mantle.

207 quere jgrb50102.pdf,I,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Introduction [ ] Seismic tomography is one of the most powerful tools 2 geophysicists have for probing the deep mantle. Tomograph- ically obtained maps of laterally varying seismic velocities reveal the signatures of subducted slabs [ Grand et al ., 1997; Vander Hilstetal ., 1997; Boschi and Dziewonski , 1999; Gorbatov et al ., 2000; Hall and Spakman , 2002; Grand , 2002; Replumaz et al ., 2004; Zhao , 2004; Wookey and Kendall , 2004; Sigloch et al ., 2008; Ritsema et al ., 2011; van der Meer et al ., 2012] littering a range of mantle depths and provide a means of constraining plate motions and slab sink- ing rates when combined with paleogeographic records that construct past subduction history [ Hafkenscheid et al ., 2006; Schellart et al ., 2009; van der Meer et al ., 2010; Liu and 1 Department of Physics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada. 2 Department of Physical and Environmental Sciences, University of Toronto Scarborough, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 3 Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns-Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA. 4 Department of Earth Sciences, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York, USA.

However, observations in a number of set- tings suggest complex subduction history [ Lee and King , 2011] as imaged slabs descend into the mantle and appear to exhibit morphologies and/or positions that are challenging to reconcile with the interpreted paleogeographic histories [ Goes et al ., 2008] and/or prevailing views of mantle struc- ture [ Morra et al ., 2007]. Accordingly, the past 15 years has seen various authors [ Morra et al ., 2010; Forte and Mitrovica , 2001] postulate that the mantle may feature a radial viscosity profile that includes relatively low viscosity zones underlying high-viscosity regions or a much higher lower mantle viscosity than previously thought. [ ] In addition to the suggestion that current slab posi- 3 tions can be used to constrain the mantle's radial viscosity profile [e.g., Steinberger , 2000; van der Meer et al ., 2010; Liu and Stegman , 2011; Cizkova et al ., 2012], some pre- vious studies have also considered the role of subduction zone shape, slab dip angle, and slab depth extent at the ter- mination of subduction to determine current slab positions [ Jarvis and Lowman , 2007]. The inferred site and history of ancient oceanic plate subduction can then be compared with the findings of the numerical models in order to pro- vide insight into slab properties, constrain mantle structure, or reinterpret the tomographic observations. [ ] Motivation for the study presented here stems from 4 the interpretation of P wave anomalies in the region below the present day positions of India and Siberia. Based on the c(""QUÃ‰RÃ‰ ET AL.: SINKING SLAB REMNANTS"", ""tomographic images, previous studies ["", ""Van der Voo et al"", "".,"", ""1999a, 1999b;"", ""van der Meer et al"", ""., 2010] have inferred that"", ""four slab remnants associated with the closing of the Paleo-"", ""Tethys and Tethys Oceans are presently observable below"", ""Siberia and India at depths ranging from mid-mantle posi-"", ""tions to locations just above the core-mantle boundary.

However, the tomographically inferred depths of the oldest slab fragments were not repro- ducible with the simple 2-D model. Subsequently, Jarvis and Lowman [2007] examined the influence of subduction characteristics (specifically, slab depth extent, temperature, dip angle, and width) and mantle viscosity profile in both 2-D and 3-D Cartesian geometry models. [ ] Our study builds on work by Jarvis and Lowman 7 [2007] and reexamines the key effects on the sinking rate of a slab that has detached from overlying stationary litho- sphere. Specifically, we focus on the influence of two added elements of realism in the numerical models, a 3-D spherical geometry and a temperature-dependent rheology. Due to the computational constraints of 3-D modeling, our approach focuses on determining parameters that can cause the sinking rates of detached slabs to vary. To this end, we compare models with different slab and mantle properties rather than trying to constrain an absolute radial viscosity for the Earth. Consequently, our study takes a comparative approach that varies one model aspect at a time in order to assess the impact on slab sinking rate. The following section briefly describes the main features of our models. The third section presents the results of our study, namely, the effects of different physical properties on the dynamics of a detached oceanic plate and the surrounding mantle. We discuss the limitations and implications of the findings with regard to slab sinking rates in the Earth and summarize our main conclusions in the final section."

207 quere jgrb50102.pdf,RD,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Results [ ] We first present a reference model, which we use to 19 illustrate details of the major characteristics of the models presented. We then describe the findings from three sets of models that address the effects of different aspects of mantle and slab properties. 3.1. Reference Model [ ] Our reference model serves as a benchmark case 20 that can be compared with subsequent models that feature systematic changes in the model setup. Initially, the slab in this model has a thickness of 120 km in the direction normal to the plane of the slab. Closest to the surface, the arc width of the slab (parallel to strike) is 3600 km, and vertically, it extends from a depth of 120 km to 660 km. We do not model a temperature-dependent viscosity in this case; thus, the slab is not rheologically distinct from the mantle. The lower mantle viscosity is 30 Ã<81> below 660 km depth, and the 0 initial slab temperature is 700Â°C. The surrounding mantle has a temperature of 1400Â°C. [ ] The panels in column 1 of Figure 2 show a sequence 21 of vertical slices that bisect the width of the slab. (We show just the temperature field within the computational domain; thus, only half of the full slab width is depicted.) The panel in the top row shows the initial position of the cold slab and the uniform temperature background field. The transi- tion from the background temperature of 1400Â°C to the slab temperature of 700Â°C (dark blue) occurs in steps across a finite interval orthogonal to the faces of the slab (indicated by the yellow and green borders around the slab in the top panels). In the radial and co-latitudinal directions, this inter- val covers 30 km; in the longitudinal direction, the gradient occurs over 60 km in order to cope with the lower resolution in that dimension. The gradual temperature transition in the envelope around the slab allows for a numerically resolv- able thermal gradient at the initial time and position of the slab, as well as simulating some degree of warming of the slab by diffusion since detachment. At 300 Myr (column 1), the slab has passed through the upper mantle/lower mantle viscosity interface (shown by the solid black line indicat- ing a depth of 660 km) but has yet to reach mid-mantle depth. After 600 Myr, the slab's thermal signature occupies the mid-lower mantle, and after more than 1 Gyr, the slab remnant has still not reached the core-mantle boundary. [ ] In Figure 3a, we show temperature at the same 5 22 times depicted in column 1 of Figure 2, as a function of mantle depth along the radius where the two symme- try planes of the slab intersect (hereafter called the axis of symmetry; Figure 1). After 300 Myr (red curve), only a very small region of the slab remains more than 150Â°C cooler than the surrounding mantle. However, an anomaly of 100Â°C does persist after 600 Myr (green curve). As the amplitude of the slab's thermal anomaly diminishes with depth, the total depth range over which the background man- tle temperature is perturbed increases, with cooler mantle c(""QUÃ‰RÃ‰ ET AL.: SINKING SLAB REMNANTS"", ""Figure 2."", ""Temperature field snapshots from three models"", ""described in the text.

[ ] Figures 14c and 14d correspond to column 2 of 55 Figure 13 and show that initially the young slab in col- umn 2 of Figure 13 sinks faster than the slab in column 1 of Figure 13. Moreover, in analogue with the increase in velocity observed as slabs descend through the mid-mantle in iso-viscous models (e.g., Figure 9d), the young slab's velocity has increased at 10 Myr (orange curve) prior to reaching the 660 km depth viscosity jump. However, ini- tially, the high-viscosity slab in column 2 of Figure 13 sinks at approximately half the speed of the slab in column 2 of Figure 8. [ ] We find very similar upper mantle velocity profiles in 56 Figures 14b and 14f, in agreement with the identical upper mantle rheology and thermal structure in these models at that time. However, in the lower mantle, we find substan- tially higher velocities in Figure 14f generated by the slab segment initially extending into the lower mantle. At 25 Myr, these velocities persist, indicating that throughout the early stages, the sinking slab segment in the lower mantle pulls down the overlying mantle and specifically the slab in the upper mantle. Discussion 4.1. Model Simplifications [ ] Our main goal is to identify major physical prop- 57 erties of the mantle and the detached oceanic plates that may explain the inferred foundering of oceanic slabs in the mid-mantle. Specifically, we focus on the controlling fac- tors on slab sinking rates in cases that allow slabs to pass from the upper mantle to the CMB. However, the detached slab model we consider is very simple and does not include some aspects of real detached oceanic plates. Here we dis- cuss some of the simplifications of our study with an attempt to assess their effects on the models described. [ ] An oceanic plate is produced at the oceanic ridge 58 axis through partial melting of the mantle which produces 3 a low-density ( 2900 kg/m ) basaltic crust of about 5Â­7 km thickness and an underlying solid residue which is 3 largely harzburgite with a density that is 60 kg/m lower than the underlying pristine mantle [e.g., Oxburgh and Parmentier , 1977]. However, upon subduction, the low-density basalt is transformed into a high-density 3 ( 3500 kg/m ) eclogite. The transformation begins at about 30Â­35 km depth in the subduction zone environment [e.g., Ruff and Kanamori , 1983] which tends to compensate for the low density of the underlying harzburgite layer. We assume that the basaltic layer of the slabs in our models has already transformed to eclogite prior to the detachment of the slab. Although the subducting plate is layered, the resultant mean density of the subducting slab, based on composition, is close to the density of the pristine man- tle. Accordingly, the density of the slabs we consider is determined entirely by temperature. [ ] Our models do not consider internal heating of the 59 mantle or the slab due to the decay of radioactive elements. Partial melting of the mantle, which results in the creation of oceanic lithosphere, tends to partition more radioactive elements in the melt. This ends up being incorporated in the c(""QUÃ‰RÃ‰ ET AL.: SINKING SLAB REMNANTS"", ""plate and in particular the oceanic crust. While radioactive"", ""heating can be neglected when considering the evolution of"", ""a plate for a few million years, it is quite important when"", ""estimating the temperature of the plate after a few hundred"", ""million to a billion years. Due to the radioactive elements,"", ""the plate will heat up more than the surrounding mantle, and"", ""this will reduce the negative buoyancy and thus the sinking"", ""rate of the plate. The reduction of the sinking rate depends"", 
""on the concentration of radioactive elements in the plate"", ""and is difficult to assess without detailed chemical analysis."", ""Moreover, the chemical segregation depends on the thermal"", ""state of the magma chamber beneath the oceanic ridge, the"", ""investigation of which is well beyond the scope of this study."", ""["", ""60"", ""] In addition, we have not incorporated the effects"", ""resulting from shear heating. As a plate sinks, the differ-"", ""ential velocity causes shearing on the surface of the slab."", 
""This heats both the slab and the immediate surrounding"", ""mantle, thus reducing viscosity and producing lubrication"", ""that enhances the sinking rate. Furthermore, shear heating"", ""along the vertical walls of the slab will increase temper-"", ""atures locally and hamper the entrainment of the adjacent"", ""mantle material observed in our models."", ""["", ""61"", ""] Assuming a similar rheology for the slab and the"", ""mantle implies that the viscosity of the slab increases sud-"", ""denly as it crosses the upper mantle/lower mantle transition"",

In order to image slabs in the lower- most mantle, slabs slowed by a mid-mantle high-viscosity layer must start to descend more quickly once through the high-viscosity barrier so that they remain cold enough to be detected in the lowermost mantle. Higher-resolution images revealing slab morphology in the middle and lower mantle may be able to settle the issue of whether slabs are slowed by a stiff layer in the mid-mantle versus sinking through an effectively uniform viscosity lower mantle, which does not produce significant slab deformation. Our study does not rule out the presence of a stiff mid-mantle layer capable of trapping slabs from a range of ages at mid-mantle depths but verifies the existence of an alternative means to explain how slabs that detached from the surface at different times may subsequently share common positions in the mid-mantle. [ ] A further complexity in mantle viscosity structure 75 that could explain the observation of a big range for mid- mantle slab ages is a lateral variation in viscosity in the top half of the mantle. Variations in the lateral viscosity struc- ture below central and east Asia [e.g., Wang and Wu , 2006] could play a role in slowing slabs. However, in the upper mantle, it is not clear whether inferred variations in vis- cosity can be separated from the influence of subduction itself. As described in this paper, diffusive cooling associ- ated with subducting slabs can act to change viscosity in the regions enveloping slabs. What is clear in global mantle vis- cosity models is that large-scale variation in lateral viscosity associated with observed large low shear-velocity provinces below Africa or the Pacific [e.g., Dziewonski , 1984; Su et al ., 1994; Su and Dziewonski , 1997; Grand et al ., 1997; Ritsema et al ., 1999, 2011] do not appear to affect viscosity in the upper mantle below central or eastern Asia [e.g., Wang and Wu , 2006]."
207 quere jgrb50102.pdf,C,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Conclusions [ ] In order to understand the inferred variation in the 76 mid-mantle depth ages [e.g., Van der Voo et al ., 1999a, 1999b; van der Meer et al ., 2010] of slab remnants result- ing from terminated subduction, we examined more than a dozen models of sinking slabs in an isothermal background mantle. Although sinking rates are largely controlled by mantle slab viscosity profile and effective Rayleigh number [ Steinberger , 2000; Jarvis and Lowman , 2005, 2007], we conclude that initial slab depth extent also provides a key controlling parameter for varying the sinking rate of differ- ent slabs in otherwise identical mantle models. In addition, we find that stiffer (temperature-dependent rheology) slabs do not sink as quickly as non-rheologically distinct slabs and that slab rheology affects the evolution of slab temperature. [ ] Once compared to conditions featuring Earth-like 77 conditions, our estimates of the times required for slabs of different initial depth extents to occupy mid-mantle depth agree with the approximately 35Â­150 Myr range for age since slab detachment inferred for mid-mantle slabs [ Van der Voo et al ., 1999a, 1999b; van der Meer et al ., 2010]. In particular, our findings may explain why the north- ernmost sub-Indian slab fragment identified by Van der Voo et al . [1999b] remains at mid-mantle depth, despite QUÃ‰RÃ‰ ET AL.: SINKING SLAB REMNANTS its inferred post-detachment age. Previously, Jarvis and Lowman [2005] modeled the opening and closing of the sub- duction zones involved in the formation of Tibet and the collision of India with Asia and found that they could not obtain the shallow location of the oldest P wave anomaly identified by Van der Voo et al . [1999b] as the slab remnant associated with subduction predating the collision of the Lhasa block with Eurasia. However, these authors modeled that slab with a thermal anomaly initially extending across the depth of the mantle while modeling shallow extend- ing slabs to obtain other sub-Indian seismic anomalies. Our findings suggest that the northernmost anomaly below India may be consistent with a viscosity increase of a factor of 30 or greater at a depth of 660 km and also a slab that had not penetrated the lower mantle prior to its detachment. [ ] We find that a minimally discussed slab property 78 plays an important role in determining the positions of the old subducted slab remnants and can result in different slab sinking rates and therefore current day positions. The upper mantle sections of slabs that initially extend into the high- viscosity lower mantle sink more quickly than less mature slabs (initially confined to the upper mantle) because as the part of the slab in the lower mantle sinks, it entrains over- lying material. Consequently, the upper mantle slab is aided in its penetration of the lower mantle and clears the upper mantle more quickly. [ ] We are grateful to W.P.

213 renaud jgrb50822.pdf,I,Journal of Geophysical Research,"1. Introduction Strong ground motion occurs most frequently where low-velocity, soft sediments overlay hard rock. When seismic waves encounter low seismic velocity material, it increases wave amplitude due to conservation of momentum. In addition, standing waves can be generated with associated large amplitudes for resonant frequencies as a consequence of the layered structure of soil deposits. The effect of the local material elas- ticity on seismic wave frequency and amplitude is broadly known as the site effect . Seismic wave-induced ground motions can be either amplified or dissipated significantly relative to bedrock, and quasi-standing wave frequencies can be altered significantly due to the phenomena of nonlinear dissipation and ""modulus reduction,"" respectively [e.g., Field et al. , 1997]. In situ observations [e.g., Johnson et al. , 2009] and numer- ous laboratory studies [ Stokoe et al. , 1999; Beresnev and Wen , 1996; Johnson and Jia , 2005; Brunet et al. , 2008] confirm that sediments under dynamic wave loading produce wave amplitude-dependent, nonlinear, and hysteretic elastic behavior due to nonlinear contact mechanics. Observations of nonlinear site effects are widespread, including from the 1994 Northridge earthquake [ Field et al. , 1997, 1998; Beresnev and Wen , 1996], the 1994 Hyogoken Nanbu earthquake at Port Island, Kobe [ Aguirre and Irikura , 1997], the 2001 M 6.8 Nisqually earthquake [ Frankel et al. , 2002], the 2003 M 7.0 w Miyagi-Oki earthquake [ Tsuda et al. , 2006], the 1989 M 6.9 Loma Prieta Earthquake [ Rubinstein and Beroza , w 2004], the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan, earthquake [ Roumelioti and Beresnev , 2003], the 1994 M 8.2 Hokkaido w Toho-oki earthquake [ Higashi and Sasatani , 2000], as well as scores of others. In situ observations [e.g., Field et al. , 1997] show that the shear elastic modulus of soil can be reduced in more than half for strain ampli- - 5 - 4 tudes between 10 and 10 [ Johnson et al. , 2009], consistent with laboratory measurements [ Beresnev and Wen , 1996]. Laboratory measurements designed to extrapolate to various earthquake ground motions are a useful com- plement to field observations. Core samples are commonly used for laboratory measurements of elastic Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2013JB010625 nonlinear behavior [ Hardin and Drnevich , 1972a, 1972b; Ishihara , 1996; Seed et al. , 1986]. A drawback in mea- suring properties from core for unconsolidated sediments is the fact that they are difficult to handle, and the soil studied in the laboratory is usually in a different compaction state than in the field. Since it is known that the elastic properties of unconsolidated soils depend on their compaction state [ Inserra et al. , 2008; Jia et al. , 2011], the extrapolation of these laboratory results to field conditions is challenging and motivates the development of in situ characterization approaches. Over the last decade, active in situ methods have been under development for probing elastic properties in the field [ Stokoe et al. , 2001, 2008; Menq et al. , 2008; Lawrence et al. , 2008, 2009; Johnson et al. , 2009]. These methods involve strong shaking of the ground from a surface vibrator and measuring the response at the surface or in boreholes. In most cases, the vibration wave provides both the elastic disturbance and is also the measured quantity used to extract nonlinear elasticity and dissipation characteristics. Recently, a two-wave, or pump-probe method known as Dynamic Acoustoelastic Testing (DAET) has been under devel- opment, where a low-frequency vibration signal disturbs the material while a high-frequency low-amplitude wave probes the disturbance through multiple cycles of the low-frequency wave [ Renaud et al. , 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013b]. Conceptually, this is identical to a laboratory acoustoelasticity measurement, where wave speed is measured as a sample is stressed [ Winkler and McGowan , 2004; Jaeger et al. , 2007; Bell , 1992; BourbiÃ© et al. , 1987]; however, in DAET the perturbation is a low-frequency wave, instead of a quasi-static load. A similar technique has been applied in situ to probe friable soils in field conditions [ Geza et al. , 2001]. Our goal in this paper is to further develop the DAET approach to in situ conditions, with the ultimate goal of developing a new technique for evaluating site response. Here we report the use of DAET to characterize the nonlinear elastic behavior of a field site near Austin, Texas, USA. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the technique in situ. We compare it to other in situ approaches, particularly nonlinear resonance spec- troscopy, wave amplitude-dependent propagation velocity, and waveform distortion induced by nonlinear propagation. We show that indeed the method can be used to extract nonlinear elastic properties of a site. We also describe modifications that would improve its applicability."
213 renaud jgrb50822.pdf,M,Journal of Geophysical Research,"2. Nonlinear Elasticity and Propagation of Elastic Waves Nonlinear elasticity is defined as deviations from Hooke's law where the stiffness (or the elastic modulus) of a material depends on the applied strain (static or dynamic) and possibly on the strain rate. In metals and polymers, the relative variation in stiffness is of order 1Â­10 per unit strain. In cracked or granular media, cracks and contacts between grains can tremendously enhance relative stiffness variations that can be of order 1000 per unit strain, thus some orders of magnitude higher than in undamaged homogeneous   solids. In a one-dimensional configuration, the equation of state relating the stress to the strain can be described as [ Zarembo and Krasil'nikov , 1971; Guyer and Johnson , 2009] ( )       ,  , 2 3 M 2 3 H (1) = +  +  + [ ] 0   where M is the linear elastic modulus, and account for classical quadratic and cubic nonlinear elasticity, 0 ,  respectively, and the term H accounts for hysteretic nonlinearity. In short, nonlinear elasticity causes [ ] the propagation of an elastic wave to be dependent on the wave amplitude. As a consequence, the wave speed and the attenuation depend on the amplitude of the elastic wave. Moreover, the waveform is dis- torted in the course of its propagation. Of importance here is the fact that elastic nonlinearity enables two elastic waves to interact with one another. If one wave has a large amplitude (pump) and the second has a small amplitude (probe), then the propagation velocity of the probe wave is modulated by the pump wave. Strain is generally considered as the main controlling parameter of nonlinear elasticity [ Guyer and Johnson , 2009]; therefore, acceleration signals (see section 3.2). 3. Dynamic Acoustoelastic Testing In Situ The purpose of DAET is to measure the wave amplitude dependence (or more generally stress dependence) of the compressibility of a material, i.e., the nonlinear portion of its equation of state (nonlinear elasticity). In DAET, we capitalize on the pump-probe concept: a material is probed simultaneously by two elastic waves, a low-frequency (LF) sine burst and a sequence of high-frequency (HF) pulses. A first source generates an LF Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2013JB010625 wave to dynamically stress a large volume of the propagation medium. A second source broadcasts the sequence of HF pulses in the studied area to determine the changes of time of flight (TOF) and amplitude of the HF pulses. Variations in the amplitude of the HF pulses correspond to changes of the HF attenuation induced by the LF forcing. Changes of TOF can be related to changes of elasticity of the soil. The nonlinear elas- tic parameters of the soil are extracted from the measured stress-induced variations in elasticity. Figure 1. Photograph of the truck-mounted shaker (&quot;T-Rex&quot;) used A unique advantage of DAET is the fact that to generate the low-frequency wave (pump wave). it employs sinusoidal elastic waves, provid- ing the means to probe the material under different stress states about the equilibrium state, producing both expansion and compression of the mate- rial as the LF signal sweeps over multiple sinusoidal cycles. As such, the method has been demonstrated to provide unique observation of complicated hysteretic behaviors and expansion-compression asymmetry in the laboratory [ Renaud et al. , 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013b]. In summary, the physical idea that informs the development and use of DAET is that in a nonlinear material, two elastic waves from independently controlled sources interact with one another. The interaction carries information about the two independently controlled elastic waves, and it carries information about the non- linear material in which these waves interact. The physical idea is sharpened in DAET, to focus on extracting information about the nonlinear material, by having the first of the independently controlled elastic wave to be of low frequency and large amplitude (the pump wave or LF wave) and having the second of the inde- pendently controlled elastic wave to be of high frequency and small amplitude (the probe wave or HF wave). Essentially, the probe wave detects the disturbance of the material brought about by the pump wave. 3.1. Experimental Configuration The site chosen for this field application of DAET is located near Hornsby Bend (Austin, Texas, USA). The field had been ploughed in the preceding decades, leaving plough tillage (with topsoil and rocks) at the ground surface. The test site was prepared by removal of surface vegetation using a tiller. The top of the vegetation and topsoil was tilled and removed by hand with a shovel to reach native sandy silt at a depth of approx- imately 7 cm. The soil at this depth had a water content of 4 to 5% and a density (wet) of approximately 3 1900 kg/m [ LeBlanc et al. , 2012]. The LF source (pump), from a mobile hydraulic shaker dubbed T-Rex (Industrial Vehicles International Inc., 2 Tulsa, USA), Figure 1, is a 4 m square base plate that presses on the ground with a DC downward force of 267 kN (66.8 kPa). This base plate is driven vertically at 30 Hz during 0.7 s (21 periods) with AC force ampli- tudes that vary from 9 kN to 222 kN. Throughout the experiment, the downward force is greater than zero, i.e., the base plate does not lose contact with the ground. A 30 cm diameter borehole was drilled to a depth of 3 m near the base plate of the T-Rex ( x = 1.9 m and y = 1.2 m; see Figure 2). Two accelerometers (one-dimensional, AC135-1A, nominal sensitivity 0.5 V/g Â± 3%, Â± 10% frequency response 0.6Â­1500 Hz, Connection Technology Center Inc., Victor, USA) were installed at a depth of 4 m (detector 1) and 5 m (detector 2) to measure the vertical component of acceleration (Figure 2). The installation process involved boring a 3.8 cm diameter hole by hand auger to the required depth, alignment and installation of the accelerometer using a 6 m long PVC pipe, and backfill with native soil of the auger hole above the accelerometer. Backfilling was performed by placing auger material in the holes and using a rod to compact the soil. Care was taken to compact the backfilled soil to the same density as the in situ soil (evaluated by volume of auger material remaining). The uncertainty of the 1 m distance between the two accelerometers is Â± 1 cm. The precision of the distance between the base plate of the T-Rex and the accelerometers is Â± 5 cm. A HF vibratory source (Redpath Geophysics, Murphys, USA) was placed at 3 m depth. The HF source (probe) is a 13 cm diameter piston moving vertically (along z direction) and broadcasting HF pulses downward. It is driven with a sequence of 1 kHz short sine bursts with duration Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2013JB010625 Figure 2.

Signal Processing and Data Acquisition The basic data sets are the acceleration time trains recorded on detectors 1 and 2 (Figure 2b). The output of the accelerometers is an analog voltage, and this is fed to a recording system at the surface which digitally  converts the signal with a sampling period of = 20  s. Each time train is split into (1) a LF part, found sample &lt; &lt; by Fourier analysis and band passing at 20 Hz f 200 Hz and (2) a HF part, found by Fourier analysis &lt; &lt; and band passing at 700 Hz f 5000 Hz. As an illustration, we show in Figure 3 a raw acceleration signal measured by the accelerometer at 4 m depth and its decomposition into LF and HF portions.   The resulting time trains, accelerations ( t ) and ( t ) , are converted to displacements u ( t ) and u ( t ) by LF HF LF HF   double time integration.

The amplitude of the HF signal at detector 2 decreases from that at detector 1 by a factor of 5.4 due to intrinsic absorption, scattering, and geomet- rical spreading of the wavefront. The first HF pulse in the sequence of HF pulses (Figure 3) propagates in . undisturbed soil; it is used to establish that the time of flight from detector 1 to detector 2 is t = 1 86 ms 0 (obtained by using a cross-correlation method applied to signals received by the two accelerometers). It corresponds to a compressional velocity V = 538 m/s Â± 1% in undisturbed material. HF In order for the results of a DAET experiment to have simple interpretation, we want the LF wave to establish a strain field that remains in place for a period of time long compared to the time during which the HF probe field encounters it, i.e., the time to travel from detector 1 to detector 2. The LF strain field has a period of . . T 33 3 ms, therefore 18 times larger than t 1 86 ms as required. The LF strain field ideally varies = = LF 0 spatially only slightly in the region traversed by the HF pulses. 3.3. Experimental Protocol The probe of the nonlinear properties of the soil is conducted with an elaborate experimental protocol. It consists of a reference run and a stepwise sequence of runs at finite LF source amplitude. The LF source (T-Rex truck) is driven successively at nominal peak force amplitudes of 9-18-9-36-9-67-9-133-9-222-9 kN. The corresponding LF strain amplitudes produced between the two buried accelerometers are given in Figure 5. A reference run at the lowest LF source amplitude (9 kN), interleaved between all runs at finite LF source amplitude, is applied to monitor potential slow evolution of the elastic properties of the site. We describe now the detailed experimental protocol. 1. The reference run. (a) The HF source is turned on and a HF pulse is broadcasted every 12.5 ms for approximately 1000 ms (Figures 3 and 4).  - 7 (b) Using the lowest LF source amplitude, strain = 9 Ã— 10 , the LF source is turned on about 50 ms 0 after the HF source is turned on and kept on for approximately 21 periods, about 700 ms.

Dynamic Pump Strain Field Between the Two Buried Detectors The dynamic strain field produced at the largest AC force (222 kN) was calculated by the numerical eval- uation of the analytical solution derived by Jones et al. [1998] (using a loss factor of 0.01). At this driving amplitude, the acceleration measured on the base plate of the T-Rex leads to a peak amplitude for the verti- cal dynamic displacement of 0.9 mm. This value is used to scale the numerical estimates detailed below. The base plate of the T-Rex is a square having a width of 2 m, and the LF wavelength for compressional waves is about 17 m. Therefore, the 30 Hz LF broadcast at the location of the two accelerometers corresponds to the case of the near field of a ""short antenna""(size of the radiating source is much smaller than the wave- length). At the largest AC force, the LF strain field theoretically calculated between the two accelerometers  . - 5 ( x = 1.9 m, y = 1.2 m, and z = 4.5 m) is such that the peak LF strain amplitudes are = 2 7 Ã— 10 , xx  .  .  - 5 - 5 = 3 1 Ã— 10 , and = 6 1 Ã— 10 (Figure 6). Thus, the largest component is the vertical LF strain , and its yy zz zz   6 - sign is opposite to that of and . The corresponding volumetric LF strain amplitude is 3 Ã— 10 ; it has the xx yy   same sign as the vertical LF strain . Note that there exist shear strain components that are smaller than . zz zz Additionally, we performed a finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulation for lossless elastic wave prop-  . 5 - agation (SimSonic) [ Bossy et al. , 2005] and obtained a vertical LF strain amplitude of 5 5 10 . The latter Ã— zz  . 5 - value is very close to that obtained with the analytical solution. Experimentally, we measured 4 9 10 = Ã— zz applying equation (2) (Figure 5) therefore in good agreement with numerical estimates.  In the remainder of the manuscript, we call LF strain the vertical component of the dynamic strain zz produced by the base plate of the T-Rex between the two accelerometers, i.e., in the region probed by the HF pulses. 3.6. Data Processing and Analysis of DAET The first data processing step is to determine the traveltime and attenuation of the HF pulses (probe) in order to observe how these quantities depend on the strength of the LF strain (pump) that the HF pulses experience.

LF The elastic nonlinearity measured in soil is complicated as we shall see. We use two approaches that allow us to simplify the analysis but nonetheless interpret the nonlinear elastic response: a time domain approach and a frequency domain approach. In particular, note that these approaches do not provide a quantification of modulus-strain hysteresis. 3.6.1. Time Domain Approach When the LF strain has reached a constant amplitude (at a given driving LF amplitude), the elastic response of soil is (approximately) in a meta stable steady state. During this period (between 80 ms and 650 ms; see Figure 7) it is possible to plot the relative variation in the elastic modulus as a function of the LF strain. Then  we apply a parabolic fit to the relation between the relative variation in the elastic modulus M M M ( ( )- ) LF 0 0  and the LF strain : LF  M ( )- M LF 0     2 .  C + + (7) E E LF E LF M 0   and are the classical nonlinear elastic parameters for quadratic and cubic elastic nonlinearity, respec- E E tively [e.g., Johnson et al. , 1996]. These parameters are defined for materials exhibiting classical nonlinear behavior due to atomic anharmonicity [ Zarembo and Krasil'nikov , 1971]; however, it is commonly used to characterize materials whose nonlinear behavior is due to grain contacts, cracks, etc. C quantifies the DC E offset of the modulation in the elastic modulus due to nonlinear material conditioning or hysteretic nonlin- ear elasticity [ Guyer and Johnson , 2009]. For both changes in elasticity and attenuation, we also calculate the time-average variation over one LF period. 3.6.2. Frequency Domain Approach In the nonlinear encounter between the probe and pump we expect the time of flight of the probe to be influenced by the timing of the LF strain, e.g., the shift in  M is modulated at frequency f and multiples of LF f [ Renaud et al. , 2008; RiviÃ¨re et al. , 2013]. The analysis of this modulation cannot be carried out by applying LF a conventional Fourier transform because the sampling period is not constant in a time trace ( M - M ) M 0 0 composed of the combination of the three components in a run. To examine evidence of the probe carrying information about the time dependence of the pump, for each run, we carry out a projection analysis of the signals d ( t )=( M ( t )- M ) M , where t , i = 1 Â·Â·Â· N are the series of time points in the run. For example, M i i 0 0 i from Figure 7b there are about 140 M M M measurements over approximately 600 ms or 18 LF periods ( - ) 0 0 T 1 f . The projection analysis, designed for sparse signal sets and/or irregularly sampled signals (see =  LF LF Appendix A), allows one to retrieve the modulation amplitude in a time trace M M M at the pump ( - ) 0 0 frequency f and multiples of f . The projection procedure is also applied to the time traces of the LF strain LF LF    ( t ) (Figure 7a) and the attenuation change ( ( t )- ) (Figure 7c). Finally, it is possible to up-sample the LF i i 0 result of the projection by using a time vector having a high sampling frequency, and the up-sampled time traces are used to plot interpolated behaviors for the time domain approach. 3.7. Analysis of LF Wave Propagation The signal broadcast from the LF source (base plate of the T-Rex) is measured by an accelerometer mounted on the base plate and by the two accelerometers that are buried at 4 m and 5 m depths. However, measuring the compressional wave speed cannot be carried out with the LF signal, because the detectors are located in the near field of the LF source. Indeed, the size of the LF source (2 m) is close to the propagation distance to the buried detectors (  5 m). In this situation, compressional and shear (and Rayleigh) waves generated by the base plate of the T-Rex overlap spatially; therefore, the arrival of the LF signal at detectors 1 and 2 cannot be simply related to a pure compressional wave. Both shear and compressional waves contribute Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2013JB010625 to the soil motion recorded by the 12 a) base plate - detector 1 two buried accelerometers. Addi- 11 base plate - detector 2 tionally, the determination of the propagation distance of the LF wave 10 is problematic because the distance between the LF source and the buried 9 detectors is close to the size of the 8 LF source. Nonetheless, it is possible to convert a relative change in delay Arrival time of LF signal (ms) 7 -6 -5 10 10 time of the LF signal recorded on the LF strain amplitude (between detector 1 and detector 2) buried accelerometers with respect to the LF signal measured on the base plate of the T-Rex (by applying a 20 b) cross-correlation method) to a relative 0 change in elasticity as the LF driving amplitude is increased.

All runs, reference and finite amplitude, have three components. Note that the choice of 1.9 ms and 3.7 ms time shifts (Figure 4) was driven by experimental time consid- erations. Three components for each run (i.e., each LF driving amplitude) add significant time sampling improvement, but more components obtained with additional time shifts would further improve the results since the soil would be probed at higher time-sampling rate, i.e., at even more different states of dynamic compression and expansion. 3.4. Static Strain Field Between the Two Buried Detectors The static strain field imposed by the DC downward force was estimated assuming an isotropically elas- tic solid half-space by the numerical evaluation of the analytical solution derived by Becker and Bevis [2004] (Figure 6).

Results How does the nonlinear character of the material involved in this study make itself known in the observa- tions that can be made? The pump modifies the material through which the probe propagates. So the probe is to be studied. But additionally, the pump interacts with itself. Consequently, we can look for evidence of the nonlinear elastic behavior of the material both in the received pump signals and in the received probe signals. 4.1. Pump As noted previously, the pump signal is recorded by an accelerometer mounted on the base plate of the T-Rex as well as at the two downhole detectors. The times of flight, calculated using a cross-correlation method, between the LF acceleration signal at the base plate and the LF acceleration signal at detectors 1 and 2 (see Figure 3), are found. In Figure 8 the relative change in elastic modulus (derived from the relative increase in the arrival time of the LF signal) is plotted as a function of the LF strain as the AC driving force is increased from 9 to 222 kN, corresponding to a LF strain amplitude (between the two buried accelerom- - 7 - 5 eters) from 9 Ã— 10 to 5 Ã— 10 . At the largest AC driving force, an effective relative decrease in elastic modulus of 50% is observed. This observation accords with a variety of similar observations [ Johnson and Jia , 2005; Nazarov et al. , 2010].  The frequency content of the pump signal ( t ) may also be analyzed, since the progressive distortion of its LF waveform as it propagates [ Hamilton and Blackstock , 1998] carries information about the nonlinear mate- rial properties. This method is commonly applied with a source able to broadcast a sine wave with very low harmonic distortion. Unfortunately, the waveform generated by seismic vibrators such as the T-Rex is signif- icantly distorted [ Lebedev and Beresnev , 2004]. In addition, the buried detectors are in the near field of the LF source. In this configuration, there exists no analytical solution to estimate nonlinear elastic parameters. Consequently, this method is not suitable to this experimental situation.

The HF wave strain amplitude and the HF wave speed in undisturbed soil remain constant during the experiment. From the time-averaged variation, we see that there is an average modulus shift to lower modulus and an average attenuation shift to larger attenua- tion, which become larger as the magnitude of the LF strain increases. Unsurprisingly, the average change in modulus experienced by the probe behaves qualitatively like the change in modulus experienced by the LF   broadcast (Figure 8). shows a fairly constant value of 1500 15 %, whereas decreases tremendously - Â± E E 9 7 - 6 - 5 from 6 10 to 2 10 as the LF strain amplitude increases from 10 to 5 10 . Ã— Ã— Ã— The dynamic component of the change in modulus (the difference between the instantaneous modulus and the average modulus) is a complicated function of the instantaneous LF strain. To look into the behavior of this part of the modulus we turn to the decomposition provided by the projection analysis. In Figure 11  we show the modulation amplitudes at f and 2 f , R and R (equation (A9)), as a function of , the LF    LF LF 1 2  strain amplitude experienced by the HF pulses. The amplitude R scales with . The amplitude R appears    1 2   to scale approximately as a power of that is less than 1. The nonlinear parameter can be estimated by  E applying a linear fit to the relation between the modulation amplitude at f ( R ) and the LF strain [ Renaud  LF 1  et al. , 2008; RiviÃ¨re et al. , 2013]. This leads to 1240 and thus accords with values calculated apply- =- E ing a parabolic fit in the plots of instantaneous changes in elastic modulus versus instantaneous LF strain (Figures 7d and 10). The linear fit applied to the LF amplitude dependence of R (Figure 11) provides a more  1  accurate estimate of because it is not affected by the hysteresis loops (Figure 7d). The measured scaling E between the modulation of the elastic modulus sensed by the probe at f and the LF strain amplitude can LF  be described by classical nonlinear elasticity ( ), but this is not the case for the modulation at 2 f ( R in  E LF 2  Figure 11). Indeed, classical cubic nonlinearity ( ) predicts a power law with a scaling exponent of 2, instead E of less than 1 as found experimentally. The slope of less than 1 in Figure 11 is consistent with the fact that  the nonlinear parameter decreases as the LF strain amplitude increases (Figure 10b). E In summary two qualities are conferred on the probe wave as it propagates through the material; it moves  more slowly, experiencing the softening of the material caused by the pump, and it acquires an and LF  2 components by coupling to the pump. In this way the probe reveals important information about the LF nonlinear character of the material. 5.1. Comparison With Lab Measurements  The estimation of the nonlinear elastic parameter with the time domain and frequency domain E 3 approaches from DAET leads to values of order - 10 , the same order of magnitude as those measured at the laboratory scale applying DAET and other techniques in room-dry rocks [ Guyer and Johnson , 2009; Renaud et al. , 2011, 2013a; Winkler and McGowan , 2004] and in unconsolidated glass bead packs [ Brunet et al. , 2008]. As Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2013JB010625 in rocks at the laboratory scale [ Renaud et al. , 2012, 2013b; RiviÃ¨re et al. , 2013], the nonlinear elastic param-  eter is not constant; it decreases (in absolute value) as the LF strain amplitude increases. Thus, classical E  cubic elastic nonlinearity ( ) is not suitable to describe the nonlinear elastic response of soil. As observed in E laboratory studies, the LF strain produces a time-average reduction of the elastic modulus in soil (Figure 10), and the higher the LF strain amplitude, the larger the softening. A reduction of the elastic modulus of 2% - 5 is observed for a LF strain amplitude of order 10 . Laboratory measurements in rocks show time-average changes in modulus of the same order of magnitude [ Renaud et al. , 2013a, 2011]. 5.2. Different Information Carried by the Pump and the Probe The time-average change in elastic modulus measured with the pump is of order 10% (Figure 8) while the probe experiences an average change in elastic modulus of order 1% (Figure 10c). This difference comes from the fact that the probe carries local information on the effect of the pump on the material. On the contrary the pump signal measured at the two downhole detectors carries information on the interaction between the pump wave and the material, from the LF source to the detectors. The effect of interaction between the pump wave and the material on the propagation of the pump wave is cumulative. Since the LF strain close to the LF source is an order of magnitude larger than at the two downhole detectors (due to diffraction loss), the average change in elastic modulus measured by the pump is expected to be larger than that measured by the probe at5mawayfromthe LF source. Additionally, the relative change in arrival time of the LF signal at 4 m or 5 m depths (as the LF strain amplitude increases) cannot be related to a rela-   tive change in the compressional wave modulus M = + 2 as in DAET. Indeed, the buried accelerometers are situated in the near field of the LF source; therefore, the LF motion measured by the accelerometers is the result of the compressional, shear, and Rayleigh wave fields generated by the LF source that coexist spa- tially at this location as noted previously. As a result the information carried by the pump and the probe is different and can only be compared qualitatively. 5.3. Comparison With Nonlinear Resonance Spectroscopy Our in situ measurements in soil can be compared to observations made applying nonlinear resonance spectroscopy in situ to soil employing the same vibrator source [ Johnson et al. , 2009]. This method allows one to measure a time-average change in elasticity. The authors reported a reduction of the shear elastic  modulus to about 56% of its value at rest, for a pump frequency and strain amplitude similar to our study. The time-average reduction in elastic modulus is therefore significantly larger than what we observed. When applying DAET in our study, the base plate of the T-Rex is driven vertically instead of transversally in the work by Johnson et al. [2009] where a shear pump wave is generated. Thus, differences between our results and those by Johnson et al. [2009] may be due to the different nature of the pump strain. The shear modu-  lus may vary more under the effect of a shear strain than under the effect of a volumetric strain having the same amplitude. This would explain why the relative reduction in soil modulus reported by Johnson et al. [2009] is larger than what we observed. Future DAET experiments could employ the T-Rex driven transver- sally in order to generate a shear pump wave; then one should be able to compare the results to the work by Johnson et al. [2009]. 5.4. Current Limitations and Future Improvements A limitation of the current setup is the fact that the soil must be removed to place the HF source and the two detectors in the borehole. Therefore, the compaction inside and outside the borehole may be different and alter the observations. An improvement of the method would be to use two (or more) boreholes, one con- taining the HF source and the other(s) containing one or more detectors. The LF source would be therefore placed in between the two boreholes, as the setup originally developed for medical ultrasound [ Renaud et al. , 2008]. Moving the HF source and detector vertically in the boreholes would enable one to probe the soil at different depths. Indeed, the nonlinear elasticity of soil is expected to be depth dependent, this being a consequence of the lithospheric pressure. Ultimately, DAET measurements could include the broadcast and analysis of the probe at multiple depths, providing the means for nonlinear elasticity of soil to be assessed at different depths. Finally, applying DAET with three different configurations for the probe (compressional wave and shear wave, different polarization of shear wave, and different propagation direction with respect to the LF pump field) as in conventional lab acoustoelastic testing [ Winkler and McGowan , 2004] could provide esti- mates of the three third-order elastic constants, required to describe classical quadratic nonlinear elasticity Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2013JB010625 in an isotropic solid material [ Zarembo and Krasil'nikov , 1971; Guyer and Johnson , 2009; Hamilton and Blackstock , 1998]."

Conclusions A methodology termed Dynamic Acoustoelastic Testing to infer nonlinear elastic properties of materials was tested in the field using a large shaker source known as T-Rex, which heretofore had only been attempted on laboratory rock specimens. Even in a relatively soft soil, clear identification of the HF probe and LF pump signals was made for a range of LF source amplitude corresponding to soil dynamic strain levels of - 7 - 5 9 Ã— 10 to 5 Ã— 10 at 4.5 m depth. Despite an experimental arraignment that may have introduced soil dis- turbance, the technique appears viable for determining nonlinear elastic parameters. Challenges remain to develop the technique for a broader application to deeper sediments and higher strains for determination of wave amplitude dependence of bulk and shear moduli. Clearly, in situ measurement of the nonlinear site response is advantageous to provide optimal information for prediction of strong ground motion at a site. DAET is a method that holds promise for doing just that. Appendix A: Projection Analysis A projection analysis, designed for sparse signal sets and/or irregularly sampled signals, employs a complete set of functions that are constructed to be orthonormal on the sparse signal set [ RiviÃ¨re et al. , 2013].

We further find that despite the relatively thin Mercurian mantle, the expected heating from the Caloris impact cannot penetrate to the core and should thus have minimal effects on a dynamo.

Mantle Viscosity and Internal Heating [ ] An increase in the mantle viscosity limits the number 39 of upwellings that can form [ Zhong and Zuber , 2001]. Thus with a higher-viscosity mantle, we might expect the spacing between plumes to increase. However, with the extreme aspect ratio in the Mercurian mantle, there may be a funda- mental limit to the size of a given plume, and therefore the total number of plumes. Thus, even if the viscosity is increased, we do not expect fewer upwellings, though at some point convection will shutdown. On the other hand if viscosity is reduced, the stagnant lid will be thinner and the plumes may reach nearer to the surface. Thus, the second phase of melting will be at similar depth as the initial melt- ing, and we may expect more similar composition between melt units. [ ] To address this question, we have run an additional 40 model (C4) in which we reduced the mantle viscosity by a Ã€ 20 1 factor of ten ( h =10 Pa s) for the 12 km s impact case. ref The temperature, composition, and instantaneous melt pro- duction are shown in Figure 11. While the number of con- Globally averaged heat flux at the surface and Figure 4. vective upwellings increases from 5 to 9, the results are CMB. While all impacts substantially elevate the surface otherwise similar to those of the higher-viscosity case. The heat flux, only the slowest (largest) impacts significantly chief difference is that because the lower-viscosity mantle heat the core. can remove heat more efficiently; it is cooler than the higher- viscosity model, Thus, the ambient melting before the impact is about 15% lower, and the volume of the far-field up from below (Figures 9a and 9c). This forms a convective melting resulting from the impact is somewhat higher. The upwelling beneath the impact site (Figure 9e), which persists Ã‚ 7 3 newly melted material from this case is roughly 8.0 10 km , for a few hundred Myr before it disorganizes (Figure 9g). or an equivalent thickness of 8.4 km if spread into the exterior Melting resulting from impact heating creates a pocket of plains in an annulus as described above, though the same highly depleted material below the impact site (Figure 9b). caveats apply to these estimates as in section 3.2. As the heated region rises, this is carried with it. A portion of [ ] We note that the key parameter responsible for this the depleted material spreads out beneath the stagnant lid. 41 variation is not the mantle viscosity, but the temperature. The convection is sufficiently vigorous that the thermal Adjusting the mantle viscosity is only one way to regulate buoyancy exceeds chemical buoyancy ( B &lt; 1), and the the temperature; it limits how much heat can be removed. deeper part of the residuum is mixed back into the mantle Another key control is the amount of radioactive heating (Figure 9d). However, the remainder is stuck within the within the mantle. This value is currently unclear. Values of stagnant lid for good (Figures 9f and 9h). The net result is K, Th, and U measured at the surface by the gamma ray that at the impact site, there is a well-mixed lower mantle, spectrometer on MESSENGER are not consistent with a overlain by a strongly depleted, high-viscosity lid, and chondritic composition and point to significant partitioning covered with volcanic plains.

With higher depth, there are no pockets of depleted material remaining; it amounts of internal heating, the mantle is so hot that it turns is all mixed into the mantle. Thus, we expect stark contrast into a magma ocean until enough of the radioactive elements between the basement rocks underlying volcanic plains have decayed. Any subsequent impact will simply remelt interior to the basin compared to those surrounding the older melt sheets. basin.

""E02007"", ""E02007"", ""12 of 15"") ROBERTS AND BARNOUIN: CALORIS AND MANTLE DYNAMICS OF MERCURY E02007 E02007 at Mercury is too fast. This counterintuitive result arises from the fact that the observed crater diameter and the size of the heated region do not scale at the same rate. Crater size grows more swiftly with velocity, suggesting that it is closer to a pure energy scaling. A faster smaller impactor heats a smaller region than a slower impactor with the same energy, although the localized heating is more intense. The heating from a slow projectile, while more diffuse, penetrates deeper. [ ] Only the slowest impactors significantly affect the 50 core heat flow (Figure 4), suggesting that the dynamo of Mercury should not have been affected by the formation of Caloris. This result differs from investigations on giant impacts on Mars, the largest of which were able to shut down a subcritical dynamo [ Roberts et al. , 2009]. [ ] We note that an oblique impact at expected velocities 51 for Mercury could mimic the effect of a slower vertical impactor, and heat deeper material. Nevertheless, the above result is not surprising, given that Mercury still has a strong magnetic field [ Anderson et al. , 2008]."
225 roberts jgre2971 (1).pdf,C,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Conclusions [ ] While the total impact melt production is largely a 52 function of impact energy, the velocity is an important control on the spatial distribution. A slower and larger pro- jectile distributes its heating over a wider volume, and thus Figure 12. (left) Temperature and (right) composition in more material is available to be potentially melted. The the Mercurian mantle immediately (a, b) before and (c, d) largest impactors can heat preexisting convective upwellings after impact for model S1.

The direct impact heating is focused the impact heating to avoid transient effects, significant melting occurs before 4.6 Gyr, as with the 2D models. This is equivalent to the planet forming with a globally averaged composition of 0.14. The true initial mantle composition of Mercury is certainly not well known, and is model-dependent [ Brown and Elkins-Tanton , 2009]. More important is the evolution of the temperature and compositional fields after that point. We observe that the melting rate postimpact is greatly reduced, signifying that the impact melting has used up much of the more easily melted material. We note that the 2D model predicts the location and timing of the melt resulting from the impact. The 3D geometry does not sub- stantially alter this. [ ] We find that the 2D models overestimate the total 48  melt production by a factor of 3. This is certainly a sig- nificant error, however, the estimates of total melt volume produced are not the focus of the current study. Moreover, the geometry is probably not the largest source uncertainty in the melt volumes. Rather, the choice of initial conditions (initial temperature profile, internal heating rate, and vis- cosity structure) is likely to be key in establishing this value (see section 3.4). 4.3.

On 1999 September 21, the Mw 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake ruptured a segment of the [ ] 1 Chelungpu Fault, a frontal thrust fault of the Western Foothills of Taiwan. The stress perturbation induced by the rupture triggered a transient deformation across the island, which was well recorded by a wide network of continuously operating GPS stations. The analysis of more than ten years of these data reveals a heterogeneous pattern of postseismic displacements, with relaxation times varying by a factor of more than ten, and large cumulative displacements at great distances, in particular along the Longitudinal Valley in eastern Taiwan, where relaxation times are also longer. We show that while afterslip is the dominant relaxation process in the epicentral area, viscoelastic relaxation is needed to explain the pattern and time evolution of displacements at the larger scale. We model the spatiotemporal behavior of the transient deformation as the result of afterslip on the dÃ©collement that extends downdip of the Chelungpu thrust, and viscoelastic flow in the lower crust and in the mid-crust below the Central Range. We construct a model of deformation driven by coseismic stress change where afterslip and viscoelastic flow are fully coupled. The model is compatible with the shorter relaxation times observed in the near field, which are due to continued fault slip, and the longer characteristic relaxation times and the reversed polarity of vertical displacements observed east of the Central Â­ Ã‚ Range. Our preferred model shows a viscosity of 0.5 1 Ã‚ 17 and 5 10 Pa s in the mid-crust below the Central Range, between 10 and 30 km depth. The low-viscosity zone at mid-crustal depth below the Central Range coincides with a region of low seismicity where rapid advection of heat due to surface erosion coupled with underplating maintain high temperatures, estimated to be between 300 the modeling of thermo-chronology and surface heat flow data.

227 rousset jgrb17375.pdf,I,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Introduction [ ] It has long been recognized that large earthquakes are 2 "" "" commonly followed by transient postseismic deformation and various mechanisms have been proposed involving either fault zone deformation or distributed viscoelastic relaxation of the medium affected by co-seismic stress change, with eventual coupling between fluid flow and deformation [e.g., Benioff , 1951; Brown et al. , 1977; Nur and Mavko , 1974; Tse and Rice , 1986; Wang , 2007; BÃ¼rgmann and Dresen , 2008; 1 Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasedena, California, USA. 2 Ecole Normale SupÃ©rieure, Paris, France. 3 Now at Earth Observatory of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. 4 Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.

The relative importance of these mechanisms is not well constrained because they can give rise to similar surface displacements [ Savage , 1990; Thatcher and England , 1998; Hearn , 2003; Bruhat et al. , 2011; Ryder et al. , 2011] and is likely to vary from place to place. Constraints on crustal and mantle rocks rheology from laboratory experi- ments [ Brace and Kohlstedt , 1980; Kohlstedt et al. , 1995; Hirth et al. , 2001; Tullis , 2002; Hirth and Kohlstedt , 2003] warrant the occurrence of distributed viscoelastic flow in the lower crust and upper mantle. Similarly, friction laws derived from laboratory experiment predict that transient postseismic slip, usually referred to as afterslip, should occur on faults obeying a rate-strengthening friction law as is expected at  depths where temperature exceeds about 250 C or near the surface within poorly consolidated sediments [ Marone et al. , 1991; Blanpied et al. , 1991; Tse and Rice , 1986]. It has turned out repeatedly difficult to discriminate the relative importance of these two mechanisms. [ ] In addition to the inherent trade-offs between the sig- 3 natures of afterslip and viscoelastic flow, the overprinting of near-fault phenomena such as fault zone collapse [ Savage et al. , 1994; Massonnet et al. , 1996; Pollitz et al. , 1998; 1of 16 c(""ROUSSET ET AL.: CHI-CHI POSTSEISMIC DEFORMATION"", ""B12405"", ""Figure 1."", ""Cumulative postseismic displacements, 10 years"", ""after the Chi-Chi earthquake (red star, epicenter).

The geological setting and"", ""deep structure of the range is also documented from various"", ""geological and geophysical studies [e.g.,"", ""Suppe"", "", 1981;"", ""2of 16"") B12405 Carena et al. , 2002; Yue et al. , 2005; Ustaszewski et al. , 2012; Kim et al. , 2005; Wu et al. , 2007]. Due to rapid exhu- mation and associated heat advection, crustal temperatures within the Central Range (CR) are unusually high [e.g.,  Simoes et al. ,2007; Lin , 2000], reaching above 400 Cat 10 km depth [ Simoes et al. , 2007]. This zone is also a region of anomalously low seismicity and low Vp/Vs ratio [ Kim et al. , 2005; Wu et al. , 2007]. The Chi-Chi earthquake induced co- seismic stress changes of the order of a few MPa in that zone of presumably low viscosity (Figure 3), which might therefore have experienced detectable viscoelastic relaxation. [ ] Whereas the study of postseismic deformation fol- 5 lowing subduction earthquakes can constrain the viscoelastic properties of the upper mantle [e.g., Khazaradze et al. , 2002; Nishimura and Thatcher ,2003; Pollitz et al. , 2006; Wang , 2007; Suito and Freymueller , 2009], here, postseismic defor- mation following the Chi-Chi earthquake offers an exceptional opportunity to study the viscous properties of the continental crust. The Chi-Chi early postseismic deformation has been attributed to mostly afterslip [ Hsu et al. , 2002; Loevenbruck et al. ,2004; Hsu et al. , 2007, 2009a], but a hint for the con- tribution of distributed viscoelastic flow even in shorter GPS time series has already been recognized [ Sheu and Shieh , 2004; Hsu et al. ,2007; Chan and Stein , 2009]. In this study, we test whether the presence of the high-temperature, low- seismicity, and low-viscosity zone below the CR can be resolved in the postseismic geodetic transient of the Chi-Chi earthquake. We use more than a decade of campaign and continuous GPS data and vertical leveling to document the history of the three-component deformation throughout the island. We reconcile the various observations using a stress- driven model of postseismic deformation, including a full account of the coupling between afterslip and viscoelastic flow. The method allows us to gauge the relative contribution of afterslip and viscoelastic deformation in a consistent man- ner, and with limited simplifying assumptions. ] In Section 2, we give an overview of the geological [ 6 setting and deep structure of Taiwan. In Section 3, we describe the postseismic transient and its unique features, and how it is isolated from other spurious effects in the GPS time series. In Section 4, we test the potential of single deforma- tion mechanisms to explain alone the geodetic observations. In Section 5, we determine a class of physical models of coupled afterslip and viscoelastic flow which explains most aspects of the postseismic transient. We finally discuss the implications for the lower-crust rheology."
227 rousset jgrb17375.pdf,M,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Earthquake Characteristics [ ] The Taiwan orogen has resulted from the collision 7 between the continental margin of the South China and the Luzon Arc on the Philippines Sea Plate [ Suppe , 1981; Angelier , 1986; Angelier et al. , 2001; Malavieille et al. , 2002].

To do so, it is necessary to single out and remove the contribution of steady interseismic deformation, seasonal variations, coseismic offsets, and other factors that affect the station position time series. Since the 1999 Chi- Chi event,many other earthquakes have occurred throughout the island, including the 2003 Mw 6.8 Chengkung, the 2006 Mw 7.0 Pingtung, and the 2006 Mw 6.1 Taitung earthquakes c(""ROUSSET ET AL.: CHI-CHI POSTSEISMIC DEFORMATION"", ""B12405"", ""Quality of fit with relaxation times for near-field"", ""Figure 4."", ""station SUN1, and far-field station FLNM.

For all stations, we"", ""5of 16"") B12405 perform an independent check of the validity of our decom- position, and verify that the inferred secular velocity is con- sistent with the results from earlier campaign GPS and leveling surveys [ Hsu et al. , 2009c; Ching et al. , 2011], for the hori- zontal and vertical components, respectively. The GPS cam- paign data are relative to the GPS station Paisha, Penghu, located in the Chinese margin, and the leveling data are rela- tive to the Keelung Harbor tide gauge in northern Taiwan. We discard the stations that, once placed in similar reference frames, do not show a consistent interseismic velocity with the campaign data. This approach is conservative and is meant to avoid contamination of poorly constrained interseismic signal in the inferred postseismic displacements. Our analysis results in about 40 estimations of postseismic transient amplitudes and relaxation times distributed all over the island. [ ] The cumulative postseismic displacements over ten 11 years after the Chi-Chi earthquake (Figure 1) reveal a well organized and complex spatial pattern of deformation. The near-field stations within the CR, east of the Chi-Chi rupture, show large westward displacements up to 15 cm with relaxa- tion time ranging from 1.2 to 2.5 years. This signal might be consistent with either slip on the down-dip continuation of the Chelungpu Fault or viscoelastic deformation of the CR. Fur- ther to the south, GPS stations show convergence across the Western Foothills, which can be explained by transient aseis- mic creep on the Chukou Thrust, the south extension of the Chelungpu Fault. Independently to their direction of horizon- tal motion, these stations experience subsidence. To the north of the rupture, the relaxation time are largely variable and the GPS stations in general extrude away from the Chi-Chi rup- ture. A striking feature in Figure 3 is the large cumulative displacements observed in eastern Taiwan, compared to, say, in the Coastal Plain and the Western Foothills at the same latitude. The stations in eastern Taiwan also consistently show subsidence and relatively long characteristic relaxation times $ ( 7 years on average) ranging from 5 up to 10 years or more. Assuming velocities that decay exponentially, the transient is 63% complete after a period corresponding to one relaxation time; after the equivalent of five relaxation times, the transient is more than 99% complete. The longer relaxation times in eastern Taiwan, quite prominent in the decade-long time series, explain why such large amplitude of cumulative displacement of the eastern coastal stations were not detected in previous studies that use much shorter periods of observation. For example, at the station FLNM, the horizontal transient motion will be 99% completed about 32 years after the main shock, whereas at near- field station SUN1 the transient is already largely completed."

However, the linear viscoelastic model predicts uniformly long relaxations times, between 5 and 10 yr, which cannot explain the rapid relaxation of near-field stations. Despite the merits of the laterally varying viscoelastic model, it cannot reproduce satisfactorily some important and robust features of the postseismic relaxation and a more complex model is needed to reconcile the various available observations. Relaxation [ ] The analysis of the scenarios involving only a single 25 mechanism reveals that a combination of afterslip and vis- coelastic flow is needed to explain the complex pattern and temporal evolution of surface displacements that occur in the decade following the Chi-Chi earthquake. We consider model D in Figure 5 where afterslip occurs on the down-dip continuation of the Chelungpu Fault and viscous strain occurs in the lower crust and mid crust below the CR. The synchronous evolution of afterslip and viscoelastic flow complicates the analysis because viscoelastic parameters affect the velocity of afterslip and the advancement of fault c(""slip reloads the viscoelastic regions.

(b) Effective relaxation times predicted by the three- dimensional viscoelastic model. The short relaxation times observed near the coseismic rupture cannot be reproduced. h Ã‚ 18 (Table 1). On the one hand, model D1, with =5 10 Pa s, 1 predicts larger strain in the lower crust beneath the Western Foothills but the incorrect polarity of vertical displacements for stations SUN1 and S167; on the other hand, model D2, h Ã‚ 19 with =1 10 Pa s, predicts the correct polarity of ver- 1 tical displacements for these stations, but over-predicts the subsidence of eastern Taiwan. These results indicate that a small variation in viscosity in the Western Foothills can greatly affect the pattern of surface uplift and subsidence and suggest that even more lateral variations of viscosity may be required to explain subtle features of the vertical displace- ments than presently considered. It is possible that the slope of the Moho - from 30 km depth in the Western Foothills to 55 km depth below the Central Range [ Kim et al. , 2005] - introduces other lateral variations of viscosity that are not captured by our model. Discussion [ ] Inference of subterranean structure from geodesy 27 alone is often non unique. However, incorporation of other 11 of 16 B12405 constraints from thermo-kinematic models, seismicity, stratigraphic topography or tomography can help us identi- ' fying models of the Earth s lithosphere that are more real- istic. The formulation of self-consistent mechanical models of deformation tuned to observations, such as presented here, can lead to a better representation and understanding of the deformation mechanisms involved in postseismic deformation. Close to the epicenter where co-seismic stress change was the strongest, the large displacements and rapid relaxation are consistent with relaxation being dominated by rate-strengthening frictional sliding on the Chelungpu Fault and its down-dip continuation as shown in previous studies [ Hsu et al. , 2002; Loevenbruck et al. , 2004; Hsu et al. , 2007, 2009a]. This mechanism alone fails to explain the large displacements and long relaxation time observed in eastern Taiwan (Figure 14), as well as the subsidence and northward displacements observed in northern Taiwan. These features require deeper and larger sources of deformation with a slower relaxation time.

227 rousset jgrb17375.pdf,C,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Conclusions [ ] The postseismic deformation following the 1999 Chi- 30 Chi earthquake exhibits a complex behavior in time and space. The transient can be explained by rapid and localized deformation driven by afterslip on the Chelungpu Fault and the abutting dÃ©collement, accompanied and followed by a slower, distributed, deformation in the lower crust. Visco- elastic flow starts at an average depth of 30 km west of the h Â­ Central Range, with a deep lower-crust viscosity of = 0.5 lc Ã‚ 19 1 10 Pa s, which is consistent with the bottom depth of seismicity in central Taiwan. Ductile deformation is much shallower in the Central Range, and extends up to 10 km Ã‚ 17 depth with a reduced viscosity of 5 10 Pa s. This zone is coincident with an aseismic domain of low seismic velocity, low Vp/Vs ratio, and higher temperatures. The low viscosity in the Central Range can be the combined result of a high thermal gradient and the presence of crustal fluids, as evi- dence from high geothermal activity and large surface heat ROUSSET ET AL.: CHI-CHI POSTSEISMIC DEFORMATION B12405 Figure 14. Merits of the afterslip, viscoelastic and coupled, models to explain the near- and far-field GPS time series. Afterslip-only models (dashed profile) can explain the short relaxation time and amplitude of near-field displacements at station SUN1, but poorly reproduce the far-field displacement at station FLNM. Viscoelastic flow models (black profile) can explain the far-field displacement well, but not the near field. Models of afterslip coupled with 3-D viscoelastic flow (blue curves) offer a better overall fit to the GPS time series across Taiwan with a lower-crust viscosity in the range 0.5 flow. Our study confirms the strong correlation among vari- ous mechanical properties of the lithosphere constrained from seismological, petrological and geodetic data and opens the way to developing more realistic descriptions of the lithosphere stress evolution that reconcile various indepen- dent geophysical observations.

In addition, assessing vertical ground displacement rates is crucial to determine relative sea level variations, which are paramount for coastal hazard assessment.

We highlight deformations with excellent precisions, the use of vertical GPS deformation constitutes a challenge. [ ] The precision of vertical positions determined by GPS 3 Â­ is typically about 3 5 times lower than for the horizontal [e.g., Bennett et al ., 2007], due to various reasons. Moreover, GPS measurements of vertical surface motion are susceptible to numerous potential errors, besides the geometric weaknesses in the height component of GPS in general. These derive from delays associated with tropo- spheric water vapor, unmodeled phase delays, mismodeled satellite orbital motions, variations in ground-based antenna phase centers, different loading processes, monument insta- bility, and others [e.g., van Dam et al ., 1994, 2001; Blewitt and Lavallee , 2002; King and Williams , 2009; Petrie et al ., 2010; King et al ., 2012]. Furthermore, biases and inconsis- tencies in the reference frame and satellite orbits, or in the processing strategy, propagate into the vertical component. fi This increases the noise level and introduces arti cial long- term trends and/or common systematic variations, correlated over large areas or continental regions [e.g., Wdowinski et al ., 1997; Johansson et al ., 2002; Dong et al ., 2006; Kierulf et al ., 2008; Fay et al ., 2008]. [ ] Since stations heights and height changes as observed 4 by GPS are related to a global reference frame, the result is c(""SERPELLONI ET AL.: GPS VERTICAL DEFORMATION IN EUROPE"", ""always directly affected by the realization and stability of this"", ""frame, especially by possible variations of the coordinate or-"", ""'"", ""igin with respect to the Earth"", ""s crust.

[ ] We present our velocities in a global reference frame 8 obtained by aligning daily loosely constrained solutions to the IGS realization of the ITRF2008, which has been shown to be far more accurate than previous ITRF solutions [ Altamimi et al ., 2011]. To determine the secular change of the station position with the highest accuracies and provide re- alistic uncertainties, we adopt a time series analysis strategy that incorporates a principal component analysis (PCA) proce- dure to estimate spatially correlated common mode error (CME), and estimates of realistic uncertainties using a maxi- mum likelihood estimation (MLE) optimization scheme. [ ] The paper is organized as follows: section 2 describes 9 the GPS/GNSS stations available, section 3 describes the data processing and postprocessing steps, section 4 describes the fi general features of the vertical velocity eld, section 5 pro- vides estimates for the glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) com- fi ponent of the vertical velocity eld in the study region, and fi section 6 describes velocity gradients at speci c cross sections along the Africa-Eurasia plate boundary and discuss the major fi geodynamic implications of the estimated velocity eld."
236 serpelloni jgrb50405.pdf,M,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Continuous GPS Networks [ ] We use raw GPS data, obtained from several continu- 10 ously operating networks in the Euro-Mediterranean and African regions. Table S1 in the supporting information lists the networks used in this work and Figure 1 shows the distri- bution of stations, with symbols colored according to the length of the time series. In Figure 1 we classify the cGPS networks into three main categories: geophysical, geodetic, and topographic. This is just a formal categorization, based on the main purposes of each network, regardless of the qual- ity of the single station monuments. However, since most of fi the geodetic networks analyzed do not provide log les or fi pictures of the monuments, it is dif cult to further detail this fi classi cation, which is still in progress.

The FN amplitudes, whilst not perhaps the correct error model, do allow a degree of compa- fi rability amongst the series. We nd that while the WN ampli- fi fi tudes from the un ltered and ltered time series remain fi &gt; mostly the same, there is a signi cant reduction ( 35%) in the amplitude of the colored noise, both assuming the special  Ã€ case of = 1 or a PL model. This suggests that the PL noise component is spatially coherent and forms most of the CME. fi The WN component is potentially site speci c and therefore fi mostly unchanged when the space-time ltering is applied. fi The remaining colored noise in the ltered series may be a fi combination of residual noise from the ltering and underly- ing more localized effects such as monument noise at poor sites that are of such amplitude that they are undetectable in fi the un ltered series. This and the change in ratio between the colored noise and WN amplitudes (colored reduced, WN unchanged) may explain the increase in standard devia-  fi tion of estimated from the ltered series. [ ] Figure 6 shows the frequency distribution of the esti- 29 mated vertical motion rates, and associated uncertainties, fi fi from both the un ltered and ltered time series. The mean vertical velocity is close to 0 mm/yr, and 95% of the GPS sta- tions analyzed move vertically in the range of Â±2 mm/yr. The fastest subsidence rates (11 mm/yr) are observed in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea (Italy), whereas the fastest uplift rates (6 mm/yr) are observed in northern Europe. Velocity uncertainties are in the range of 0.1 to 2 mm/yr, with a mean velocity error of 0.39 mm/yr and a standard deviation of 0.29 mm/yr. Most (95%) of the GPS stations show a velocity &lt; uncertainty 0.95 mm/yr. It is worth noting that the uncer- fi tainties estimated from ltered time series, adopting the same &gt; noise model, are on average 40% smaller than ones from fi un ltered time series. The estimated vertical velocities and uncertainties are reported, together with other parameters, in Table S2 of the supporting information."
236 serpelloni jgrb50405.pdf,RD,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Description of the Vertical Velocity Field [ ] As anticipated in section 1, the absolute (i.e., IGS08) 30 vertical rates might be slightly biased, with the bias evolving "" with latitude, and thus uplift and subsidence are not abso- "" fi lute and might be shifted in location, making dif cult the in- terpretation of vertical rates, particularly when rates are small. Moreover, since GPS motions are tied in the global fi ITRF/IGS reference frame, and this frame is not xed to the solid earth (i.e., the coordinate origin of the ITRF is tied to the center of mass of the total Earth system, not to the center of mass of the solid Earth), this may cause an unknown base- line shift between actual vertical velocities and ground motion rates as, for example, predicted by geodynamic modeling. For this reason, in order to use the vertical rates provided in this work in modeling or for comparisons with other vertical data, velocities should be realized with respect to local relative frames. fi fi [ ] The nal vertical velocity eld, obtained from the 31 fi analysis of the ltered time series (cleaned by outliers, off- sets, and seasonal terms), assuming a PL + WN noise model, is shown in Figure 7. The fastest uplift rates in the European- Mediterranean region occur north of 54Â°N, a signal domi- nated by the ongoing postglacial rebound processes [e.g., Johansson et al ., 2002; Nocquet et al ., 2005]. Since in this re- gion our velocity estimates agree with previous solutions, 6011 these will not be discussed here. Over central Europe, the spatial distribution of stations is quite uniform but with low density. On average, central Europe (including central and northern France) appears rather stable, with a median vertical velocity of 0.1 Â± 0.9 mm/yr. Only few stations show larger &lt; velocities but generally 1 mm/yr, probably related to local process. [ ] The Iberian Peninsula (see Figure 9 for the toponyms) 32 has a dense spatial distribution of data, which show a rather well-constrained pattern of regional subsidence but with varying rates. Uplift is localized in central Iberia, and in southeastern Spain, few stations show positive or stable ve- locities. On average, the fastest subsidence rates are close Ã€ to 3 mm/yr and are located in southern Spain. Along the Mediterranean costal region, subsidence is faster close to the Gulf of Cadiz and decreases eastward, approaching zero close to the southern Pyrenees and southern France. Some of the observed features in the western Mediterranean are new, since previous solutions [e.g., SantamarÃ­a-GÃ³mez et al ., 2012], although showing some similar trend at sites fi along the coasts of southern Spain, are signi cantly sparser than our geodetic solution. [ ] In the central Mediterranean area (i.e., Italy and sur- 33 roundings, see Figure 10 for the toponyms), our geodetic fi solution is signi cantly denser than in other regions and in comparison to previously published works [ Baldi et al ., 2009; Devoti et al ., 2010, 2011; Bennett et al ., 2012] show- ing spatially coherent vertical velocity patterns both at short and long spatial scales. The Alpine domain shows a general uplift. Faster uplift rates (~2 mm/yr or even faster at few points) are observed in the western and central Alps, and decrease toward the eastern Alps to stable or negative values Ã€ up to 2 mm/yr in the Slovenian Alps (east of 13Â°E). In the Pannonian-Carpathians region, the number of stations is fi more limited and the velocity eld indicates a slow subsi- dence in the Hungarian plain and stable or slow uplift in the Carpathians. [ ] The Po Plain (northern Italy, see Figure 10 for the top- 34 onyms) is rather stable in its western sector, showing increas- Ã€ ing subsidence rates (faster than 3 mm/yr) toward the northern Adriatic coasts, where subsidence rates are as large Ã€ as 8 mm/yr (e.g., near the Po River delta), and fast subsi- dence rates at sites near the NW-SE striking northern Apennines frontal range. In the Apennines chain, we observe fi signi cant changes in the vertical velocity pattern both along and normal to the chain axis. While the northern Apennines (i.e., the Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna sectors) show slow vertical velocities and a general slow subsidence, the cen- tral (~2 mm/yr) and southern (~1 mm/yr) sectors of the Apennines chain clearly show uplift. This positive signal is localized along the chain axis, characterized by the higher topographic relief, particularly in the southern Apennines (i.e., Campania and Basilicata). fi [ ] In Calabria (southern Italy), we nd difference between 35 its western subsiding (Tyrrhenian) side, with rates close to Ã€ 3.5 mm/yr, and its eastern uplifting (Ionian) side, with rates close to 1.5 mm/yr. A fast subsidence characterizes the central fi Aeolian Islands (southern Tyrrhenian Sea), where we nd the fastest subsidence rates of the central Mediterranean region Ã€ (down to ~ 10 mm/yr). Vertical velocities in Sicily show &lt; Ã€ slow subsidence in the southeast ( 1 mm/yr), which turn &lt; into slow uplift rates ( 1 mm/yr) in the north, along the SERPELLONI ET AL.: GPS VERTICAL DEFORMATION IN EUROPE Predicted vertical surface motion rates due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) in the Euro- Figure 8. Mediterranean area obtained adopting our implementation of the ICE-5G and the KL05 models, respectively.   The A-A and B-B lines and the dashed boxes refer to the cross sections plotted in Figure S6. Nebrodi and Madonie Mountains. To the south, the Pelagian stations Malta and Lampedusa are stable, while the Ã€ Pantelleria volcanic island is subsiding at fast rates (~ 3 mm/yr). [ ] On the eastern side of the Adriatic Sea, the number of 36 GPS stations available in our solution is limited, and the few vertical velocities are close to zero (northern and central Ã€ Croatia) or negative (~ 1 mm/yr) in southern Croatia. In Albania, the few sites available show variable vertical veloc- ities, including uplift and subsidence, and do not provide fi signi cant indications. On the contrary, in the Balkans fi Mountains of Bulgaria, we nd a rather coherent uplift at rates of ~1.5 mm/yr. The limited number of stations in the Hellenic arc indicates a coherent pattern with continental Ã€ Greece and Corinth Gulf subsiding down to ~ 2 mm/yr and Crete and the Cyclades uplifting at rates of ~1.0 mm/yr. [ ] In the eastern Mediterranean, aside two station at 37 Cyprus and in southern Turkey, a coherent and robust solu- tion in the Levantine (mainly in Israel) highlights an increas- ing rate of uplift, up to ~2 mm/yr, closer to the Dead Sea fault trace. of Vertical Velocities [ ] The measured velocities result from the combination 38 of geodynamics, tectonics, GIA, and other unknown pro- cesses. Accounting for GIA is fundamental for the interpreta- tion of sea level and modeling of geodynamic processes [e.g., Lambeck and Purcell , 2005; Stocchi et al ., 2005]. Here the effect of GIA at GPS sites is modeled by an improved version of the open-source code SELEN [ Spada and Stocchi , 2007]. SELEN numerically solves the sea level equation [ Farrell and Clark , 1976], which describes the spatiotemporal variations of sea level associated with melting of the late Pleistocene ice sheets, for a laterally homogeneous, spheri- cal, and self-gravitating Earth with Maxwell rheology, in- fl cluding the effects of rotational uctuations on sea level [ Milne and Mitrovica , 1998] and accounting for horizontal migration of shorelines [ Peltier , 2004]. 6012 [ ] In our GIA computations, we have implemented two 39 global models characterized by distinct mantle rheologies and time histories of the mass of continental ice sheets since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The two models are constrained by different global data sets of relative sea level variations since the LGM, which motivates their different pa- rameterizations. These are the ICE-5G (VM2) [ Peltier , 2004] (hereafter indicated as ICE-5G) and the ice model progres- sively developed at the Research School of Earth Sciences of the National Australian University [ Lambeck et al ., 1998, and subsequent contributions]. Since this latter ice model is valid as of 2005, it is referred to as KL05 in the fol- lowing. The ICE-5G model does not account for the melting of the Alpine ice cap, while the KL05 models does. This con- fi tribution has been evaluated by Stocchi et al . [2005], nding that it accounts for a small fraction (~10% in the western Alps) of the estimated vertical GPS rates. fi [ ] The viscosity pro les of ICE-5G and KL05 mainly 40 differ in the lower mantle, where the adopted average viscos- 21 ity values are 2.7 and 2.0 Ã— 10 Pas, respectively. As discussed by Stocchi and Spada [2009], lower mantle viscos- ity has a major role in the assessment of present-day sea level variations and vertical movements associated with GIA across the Mediterranean Sea. Models characterized by a relatively large lower mantle viscosity have the tendency to produce faster displacement rates at present, because of the larger isostatic disequilibrium implied. Other model parame- ters such as the shallow upper mantle viscosity (0.5 and 0.3 Ã— 21 10 Pa s in ICE-5G and KL05, respectively) and the thick- ness of the elastic lithosphere (90 and 65 km) play a compar- atively minor role. As noted by Stocchi et al . [2009], the GIA-induced sea level variations in the Mediterranean are particularly sensitive to the melting chronology of the fi Antarctic ice sheet, which differ signi cantly in the two GIA models (a short account of these differences has been recently given by Spada and Galassi [2012]). [ ] Our GIA predictions are given in the reference frame 41 of the center of mass of the whole Earth, so it is nominally comparable with our absolute IGS08 estimates.

Applying the GIA correction to the measured vertical veloc- ities at GPS sites around the Mediterranean changes the GPS rates by up to 0.5 to 1 mm/yr, depending on the model used, which, in general, gives faster uplift rates and slower subsi- dence rates, as shown in the cross sections presented in section 6. and Geodynamic Implications [ ] We plot vertical velocities along cross sections sam- 42 pling different sectors of the Euro-Mediterranean region, par- ticularly those where a denser distribution of GPS stations is available in our geodetic solution. We interpolate the ob- served discrete vertical velocities using an adjustable tension continuous curvature surface gridding algorithm [ Smith and fi Wessel , 1990]. The interpolated vertical velocity elds for the western, central, and eastern Mediterranean, together 6014 fi Â­ les of Figures 11 13. with traces of the cross sections, are shown in Figures 9,  10, and 14, respectively. Velocities (with 1 error bars) of fi GPS stations located inside the pro le swath are plotted with fi respect to the distance along the pro le track, together with the median, maximum, and minimum values of the vertical fi rates, estimated from the smoothed velocity eld and sam- fi pled at steps of 1 km along the swath pro le. The cross sec- tions highlight some remarkably new features of the ground motion rates measured by GPS, which are discussed in the next sections. 6.1. Iberia [ ] The morphological structure of the Iberian Peninsula 43 is characterized by a moderate average elevation, together fl with at surface (the so-called Iberian Meseta). Much of this topography feature has been acquired recently post-Miocene/ Pliocene age, postdating the main compressional phases [e.g., Casas-Sainz and de Vicente , 2009]. Tectonic activity fi is mainly con ned in southern Iberia and the Pyrenees, where fi signi cant geodetic strain rates have also been measured [ Stich et al ., 2006; Serpelloni et al ., 2007], whereas central and northern Iberia appear tectonically stable. c(""["", ""44"", ""] The cross sections in Figure 9 highlight undulations of"", ""the vertical velocity patterns both N-S (A-A"", """", "")and E-W(B-B"", """", ""),"", ""occurring at both long spatial lengths ("", ""&gt;"", ""300 km), as along"", ""the A-A"", """", ""pro"", ""fi"", ""le, and shorter spatial lengths (~100 km) as"", ""along the B-B"", """", ""pro"", ""fi"", ""le.

The coast of northern Lebanon reveals faster uplift than the rest of the Levantine coasts during late Holocene [ Morhange et al ., 2006]. However, the geodetic vertical velocities appear sensibly faster than from Holocene and upper Pleistocene data. Conversely, very fast uplift is recognized along growing salt dome at Mount Sedom along the Dead Sea, occurring at Â­ ~5 8 mm/yr, probably at a stable rate over the last 14 ka [ Weinberger et al ., 2006]. Similar rates have been found using interferometric synthetic aperture radar and GPS over the entire northern Dead Sea, with maximum uplift rates of ~4 mm/yr along the northeast cost of the Dead Sea [ Nof fi et al ., 2012]. Our vertical velocity eld is in agreement with the Nof et al . [2012] results, suggesting a correlation with to- pography, and an increasing rate of uplift moving toward the Dead Sea coasts, suggesting that high rates could be related to elastic unloading due to water level reduction in the lake."

Although inherently spatially heterogeneous, due to the distribution of the available networks, the large number of stations in our geodetic solution allows us to high- light coherent patterns of vertical ground motion trends, showing velocity gradients at different spatial scales along the Africa-Eurasia plate-boundary in southern Europe.

237 shelley jgrb50623.pdf,I,Journal of Geophysical Research,"1. Introduction Seismic anisotropy is increasingly being used as a geophysical tool to investigate the Earth's interior. Differ- ential stress in the upper crust can create anisotropy through the closure of aligned cracks and mechanical discontinuities present in the rock mass [ Nur and Simmons , 1969; Crampin , 1994]. This relationship provides a convenient way to monitor stress orientations in the crust, especially when there is a lack of geodetic observations (GPS, interferometric synthetic aperture radar, etc.) and studies of earthquake focal mech- anisms are untenable. Possible changes in seismic anisotropy linked to volcanic activity associated with relatively short-term (days to years) magmatic processes [e.g., JÃ³nsson , 2009] have been investigated as more complete data sets are collected [ Savage et al. , 1990; Munson et al. , 1995; Bianco et al. , 1998; Gerst and Savage , 2004; Savage et al. , 2010; Johnson et al. , 2010]. However, there have been few quantitative studies on the effect of stress on in situ anisotropy measurements. Understanding of how anisotropy around volca- noes changes over time provides a potential tool for forecasting volcanic activity and in addition will provide insight into the role of stress-induced anisotropy in the upper crust. We use computer modeling to investigate how changing stress conditions may affect crack-induced anisotropy. To do this, we model shear wave splitting in earthquakes using the interaction between crack-induced anisotropy and stress conditions during the 2004 eruptive episode at Mount Asama Vol- cano, Japan, and compare the results with shear wave splitting measurements made by Savage et al. [2010]. We also demonstrate the application of the analytical relationship between stress and elastic anisotropy proposed by Gurevich et al. [2011] to the three-dimensional stress and ray path model. Future models can potentially incorporate other analytical or empirical stress-anisotropy relationships. Forward modeling of the effect of anisotropy on shear waves is carried out using a method adapted from that used by Abt and Fischer [2008], described later. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2013JB010817 Seismic anisotropy arises from the presence of discontinuities, crystal-preferred orientations, and material heterogeneities in rocks. These types of features are all present in the brittle upper crust [e.g., Godfrey et al. , 2000]; however, over the rela- tively short time periods over which volcanic activity occurs we do not expect any significant reorientation of crystal lattices or redistribution of rock material. The mechanical nature of discontinuities, however, has been shown to respond rapidly to the application of a nonuniform stress [ Zatsepin and Crampin , 1997]. Small-scale discontinuities, such as Figure 1. The red dashed line is the earthquake to station distance. Three rays are traced with successively increasing incident angles with respect cracks and grain contacts (microc- to the event. R is projected, and the ray destination is closer to the event racks), preferentially close relative to 1 than the station. The incidence angle is increased, the result being R , 2 their alignment normal to the maxi- whose destination is further away than the station. At this point incidence mum compressive stress direction, so angles in between R and R are projected until ray R is found, whose 1 2 3 that the distribution of microcracks destination is suitably close to the destination station. in terms of their effect on the over- all elastic properties of the rock mass becomes anisotropic. This means that, as long as there is a degree of differential stress, particle motion parallel to the direction of maximum compressive stress is mechanically less impaired than orthogonal particle motion, resulting in higher velocities [ Babuska and Cara , 1991]. In the case of shear waves, velocities in an anisotropic medium vary depending on their polarization. Measuring the direction of the fast polarization and the delay time from earthquake S waves provides information on the orientation and strength of anisotropy present in the rock medium that the ray passed through. Micro- cracks are generally assumed to be randomly oriented and thus isotropically distributed over macroscopic scales, as opposed to large-scale discontinuities (fractures) that tend to be in aligned sets. This is due to the nature of the microcracks being created during deposition (in the case of grain contacts in sedimentary rocks) or postrock formation after initial high temperature and pressure conditions are lifted [ Walsh , 1965], rather than large-scale fractures which occur due to more consistent tectonic forces. There is an inherent ambiguity when analyzing changes in anisotropy measurements from earthquake-generated waves, as it is hard to determine whether changes can be attributed to temporally evolving conditions or to effects dependent on path or source conditions [e.g., Zinke and Zoback , 2000; Johnson et al. , 2011]. There may only be a relatively short period of time during which magma body infla- tion or deflation is occurring, limiting the number of available seismic events that sample these transient stress states. This makes distinguishing between temporal and spatial changes in anisotropy vital to attain a robust interpretation of data. In order to predict the spatial component of anisotropy expected to coin- cide with volcanic activity, Coulomb stress modeling has been used as an aid for comparative interpretation between measurements and the assumed stress field [ Savage et al. , 2010; Johnson et al. , 2011; Roman et al. , 2011]. Two-dimensional tomography [ Johnson et al. , 2011] has also been implemented; however, there is a comparative lack of three-dimensional models looking at stress-induced anisotropy in the crust and around volcanoes. A three-dimensional model will provide the potential to take into account not only the state of stress as it changes vertically and laterally but also the propagation direction of the ray and the stress contribution from loading. By modeling shear wave splitting caused by stress in three dimensions, the con- tribution made by stress-induced anisotropy can be further constrained in order to aid future interpretation of splitting measurements."

Seismic Ray Tracing The model space for the ray tracing and subsequent anisotropy calculation consists of a three-dimensional ordered array of cubes, to which each are assigned uniform material properties. The resolution of the blocks governs the minimum resolvable features in the model. Model coordinates are normalized around the center of the dyke feature being modeled, with depths being measured relative to sea level. A one-dimensional subsurface seismic velocity model is used to trace ray paths through the model space. P wave velocities around Asama inferred from an active source seismic experiment [ Aoki et al. , 2009] are averaged over each depth and then interpolated to the specified model depth increments (see Table 1). S wave velocities are found assuming a V / V of 1.7, after Savage et al. [2010]). This velocity model is also used p s to constrain elastic data in the stress model. A further constraint about near-surface density at Asama is provided by cosmic ray muon radiography [ Tanaka et al. , 2007]. For simplicity, we employ a one-dimensional 3 3 - - density model that increases linearly with depth from 2500 kg m at the surface to 3000 kg m at 30 km below sea level. Each ray path is traced through the model by finding incidence angles at set depth levels using the 1-D velocity model. This is achieved by iteratively evaluating successively finely spaced ray path angles until the path that has the station as the destination is found (see Figure 1). A common ray approximation, where each polarized shear wave follows the same ray path, is assumed throughout the model. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2013JB010817 Regional events occurring beneath 30 km, outside the model space, are traced using the same technique at a lower resolution using the 1-D veloc- ity/density model, AK135 [ Kennett et al. , 1995], in order to find the loca- tion at which the ray path pierces the stress model boundary. 2.3. Stress and Anisotropy Calculations We approach the subsequent model- ing in three successive ways in order to investigate the influence of the magnitude and orientation of vol- canic stress on anisotropy. First, we consider stress magnitudes in isola- Figure 2.

Also shown is the regional seismic network situated a basic approach to investigate the around Asama, with station AVO indicated. link between modeled stress orienta- tions and measured fast directions, as well as crack density and measured delay times. Last, we look at the effect of both stress orientation and magnitude on modeled shear wave splitting. Combining stress models and the traced ray paths allows us to quantify, for each ray, the range of stress magnitudes in the raypath vicinity due to dyke inflation. Under the assumption that stress is the source of anisotropy changes in the crust, it is useful to know to what degree the stress field is perturbed by volcanic sources for each raypath. Hypothetically, greater stress magnitudes from the dyke source would result in a more pronounced effect on shear wave splitting. In the simplest case of stress-induced anisotropy arising from crack closure (all else being equal), the magnitude of a stress perturbation in a volume should correlate well with the magnitude of anisotropy change. This analysis gives insight into stress interaction with ray- paths which can then be compared with the shear wave splitting measurements to assess the relationship between the two. To be able to model anisotropic effects on a shear wave, its medium's elastic properties must be calculated.  Hudson [1981] provides first-order relationships between crack density ( ) and the stiffness tensor ( C )for ijkl  a rock with an aligned set of circular cracks. These are valid at dilute crack concentrations ( 1 ). They iso are characterized by the isotropic stiffness tensor, C , defined by the rock's LamÃ© parameters, modified by an some constant, C , such that iso an C C C (1) = + ijkl Due to its symmetry, the fourth-order elastic tensor can be defined as a second-order tensor (see an Appendix A). For dry cracks, the nonzero elements of C are    2 ( + 2 ) 4  an an an an C = C = C = C =- ( )    11 12 21 22 3 ( + )    2 ( + 2 ) 4  an an an an C = C = C = C =- ( )    13 31 32 23 3 ( + )   3 ( + 2 ) 4  an C =- ( )    33 3 ( + )    ( + 2 ) 32 an an  C = C =- ( )   44 55 3 3 4 ( + ) Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2013JB010817    3 where and are the LamÃ© parameters of the medium, and is crack density, or Na , with N being the number density of cracks and a being the mean crack radius. For fluid-filled cracks a different formulation an for the C matrix is derived based on a model in which shear traction on the crack is zero and there is only an displacement in the transverse direction [ Hudson , 1981]. In this case, the nonzero elements of C are   + 2 32   an an C = C =- ( )   44 55 3 3 4 +  C can then be calculated for a given using LameÃ© parameters derived from seismic velocity and density ijkl  data. A number of models are created in which different values of , which are constant throughout the model space, are used. Finally, we incorporate stress magnitude and orientation into the determination of the medium's elastic properties using the analytical relationship developed by Gurevich et al. [2011]. This differs from Hudson's method by calculating the perturbation from the isotropic rock state using stress magnitude as a scaling factor. It is assumed that all cracks are identical and can be described by their area and the ratio between their normal and tangential excess crack compliance. In this case, the underlying framework of determining crack-induced elastic anisotropy is the noninteractive approximation made by Sayers and Kachang [1995], which is based on the assumption that there are no stress interactions between cracks. The accuracy of this approximation holds only if the positions of the cracks are random, as the presence of cracks in some pattern of alignment will have an overall effect on the average stress field. The change in compliance due to the presence of cracks given by Sayers and Kachang's approach is 1          S (2)  = ( + + + )+ ijkl ik jl il jk jk il jl ik ijkl 4  where is a second-order tensor defined as ij  1  r r r = B n n S ij r T i j V r  And is a fourth-order tensor defined as ijkl  1  r r r r r r = ( B - B ) n n n n S ijkl r N T i j k l V r r r r where B is the normal and B the shear crack compliance term for the r th crack in volume V, n is the i th N T i component of the r th crack normal, and S is the crack area. r   Gurevich et al. [2011] express the dependence of tensors and as a function of stress using the ij ijkl r following relationship between stress and specific crack area, s = A  V , at a given orientation:  0 s = s exp (  P ) (3) n c  0 where s is the specific area of all cracks before any stress is applied, is the normal stress traction acting on n the crack surface, and P is some characteristic pressure at which cracks will close. Substituting this relation- c   ship into formulation for tensors and gives solutions that provide the stress-dependent compliance ij ijkl tensor, S . This tensor, containing five independent coefficients and thus having hexagonal symmetry, ijkl can be calculated using the isotropic rock compliance, the stress state, and the crack compliances. The corresponding stiffness tensor is the inverse of the compliance tensor. There are several assumptions that have been made e motions by Gurevich et al. [2011]: 1. The rock is assumed be rheologically elastic, an assumption also used by the stress model. This assump- tion is more problematic when considering volcanic processes, as rocks surrounding magma chambers will undergo a degree of thermomechanical weakening, and studies have found that taking a viscoelastic approach to modeling rheology can significantly reduce the magma chamber pressures needed to match ground deformation when compared to elastic models [e.g., Newman et al. , 2006; Del Negro et al. , 2009]. Stress may also cause failure in rocks, and even in low stress conditions heterogeneities may serve to con- centrate stress and produce local cracking. However, since the volcanic source mechanics are previously Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2013JB010817 determined inputs in this model, viscoelastic effects on the rock anisotropy due to thermomechanical weakening will be confined to raypaths that pass nearby the magma source. Otherwise, assuming an elastic rheology is considered applicable to well-consolidated rocks when applied stresses, particularly deviatoric stresses, are small (below 10 to 30 MPa) [ Gurevich et al. , 2011]. 2. The sole cause of anisotropy in the rock is assumed to be stress-aligned microcracks, meaning an unstressed rock would be isotropic. This neglects other forms of anisotropy, such as bedding planes, frac- tures, and mineral fabric. However, the aim of this model is to investigate how volcanic stresses would affect shear wave splitting, so model-observation variations consistent with structural effects will still provide useful data. 3. Due to the use of the noninteractive approximation of Sayers and Kachang [1995], the cracks are assumed to be sufficiently sparse so that the overall rock compliance is simply a sum of the effects of individual cracks, disregarding any stress interaction between cracks. The analysis done by Grechka and Kachang [2006] shows that this is satisfactory for a range of irregular and intersecting approximately flat cracks up  . to substantial crack densities of at least 0 15 . = 4. The cracks are assumed to be dry, in the sense that there is no hydraulic interconnectivity between them. Changing the compliance ratio of the cracks would effectively simulate having water, oil, or any fluid other than air as crack fillers, but any interaction between the cracks must be excluded. This is a strong assump- tion to make in volcanic regions such as Asama, due to a prevalence of hydrothermal systems at volcanoes [ Aizawa et al. , 2008] and a high water table in the Asama region [ Kazama and Okubo , 2009]. This is perhaps the most significant of the assumptions, as microscale fluid flow between cracks is expected to modify the effect of small differential stress on overall anisotropy [ Zatsepin and Crampin , 1997]. 5. The exponential expression for specific crack area ( s , see equation (5)) is simplified to a linear relation- ship [see Gurevich et al. , 2011]. This assumption has the effect of limiting the model accuracy to stresses that are small compared to the crack closing pressure. In our models, we approached this by setting max- imum compressive stress to the crack closing pressure in the equations for calculating rock anisotropy for model blocks where the stress exceeds the closing pressure, in order to avoid a breakdown in the linear approximation. 2.4. Determining Shear Wave Splitting Parameters In order to find the shear wave splitting parameters of a ray path, the incremental anisotropic effects on the seismogram for paths through each block that the ray travels through was calculated. Then the method of Silver and Chan [1991] was applied to calculate the splitting parameters from the predicted seismogram at the receiver. We adopted the method of calculating shear phase particle motions used by Fischer et al. [2000] and Abt and Fischer [2008]. For each ray segment, the Christoffel matrix was defined as Babuska and Cara [1991]: 1 m = ( c n n ) (4) il  ijkl j k  where is the density, and n and n are the ray path's directional cosines. The three eigenvalues of the j k Christoffel matrix are related to the anisotropic velocity and polarization properties of the wave. Given that 1  &gt; &gt;  , the fast shear wave component velocity, V , and the slow component velocity, =( ) 2 1 2 3 f 2 1  V , with the corresponding eigenvectors giving the respective polarization directions. The time =( ) 2 s 3  1 1 - - shift accrued for each ray segment, t , is equal to L V V , where L is the segment length, and the fast ( - ) n s f  direction, , is the fast polarization direction eigenvector orthogonal to the raypath. The resulting particle n motion, u , for a path with m ray segments is defined by Fischer et al. [2000] as [ ]  m      T u R D t R u (5) ( )= ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) n n n 0 n = 1 where [ ]   cos sin  T n n R ( )=   n - sin cos n n and [ ]  i t  2 e 0 n  D ( tn )=  - i t  2 0 e n Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2013JB010817 The splitting parameters that best fit the ray path are those that, when applied to the split wave,   return the most linear motion. This is achieved by finding the and t values that produce the most singular covariance matrix (which is attained when the matrix has only one nonzero eigenvalue) [ Silver and Chan , 1991]. The initial particle motion that propagated through the model, u , is a simple sine wavelet. The most com- 0 mon frequency window used for the crustal splitting analysis done at Asama by Savage et al. [2010] had a high pass of 3 Hz for local events (depth &lt; 2.2 km below sea level) and around 1 Hz for regional events (depths between 40 and 156 km). We chose a wavelet with a frequency of 1 Hz to use in the model in order to represent a frequency found in the majority of frequency windows, while giving the wavelet an acceptable sample width (1000) for analysis. Abt and Fischer [2008] performed a comparison between this particle perturbation method of calculating splitting parameters with calculations made using full synthetic waveforms generated using a pseu- dospectral approach. They considered a vertical boundary between two volumes with different anisotropic properties, finding that in the full-waveform case, interaction of the wave front with the boundary results in an observed difference in splitting measurements from the simple perturbation method, arising from waveform distortion and possible ray bending. These effects are most pronounced with large contrasts in effective velocity. This may present a problem for stress model examples where the size of a stress perturba- tion is comparable to the grid size, as large changes in stress orientation and, to a lesser degree, magnitude may be expected; however, since the modeled stress field expresses incremental spatial variations, these effects will diminish with higher block resolutions. 2.5. Volcanic Stress at Mount Asama Mount Asama is an active andesitic volcano situated in central Japan at which numerous vulcanian erup- tions occurred at the summit crater during the first half of the twentieth century (1910Â­1960), the frequency of which decreased after 1940. In the second half of the last century eruptions were more infrequent, cul- minating in a moderately large (volcanic explosivity index of 2) eruption in 2004 and minor eruptions in August 2008 and February 2009 [ Takeo et al. , 2006; Savage et al. , 2010; Murase et al. , 2007; Nagaoka et al. , 2010]. The 2004 and subsequent eruptions have been well monitored and documented with both seismic and geodetic data, allowing the various magmatic sources to be determined [ Takagi et al. , 2005; Takeoetal. , 2006]. This forms the basis for a first-order constraint on the volcanic stress to be used in the forward model. In order to model the contribution to the stress field from processes associated with volcanism for input into the forward model, a priori knowledge of the magma plumbing system is required. The 2004 erup- tion at Mount Asama was accompanied by surface deformation and seismicity that has been used to infer a likely magma supply path beneath Asama [ Takagi et al. , 2005; Takeoetal. , 2006]. Using geodetic and seis- . 6 3 mic data, Takeo et al. [2006] proposed that between June 2004 and March 2005, 6 8 Ã— 10 m of magma was intruded into a near-vertical dyke system trending broadly E-W and extending from 3 km to 5.1 km below sea level. This dyke model has subsequently been imaged as part of a zone of high seismic velocity that sig- nifies repeated past dyke intrusion and cooling [ Aoki et al. , 2009]. In the final models used in the anisotropy modeling we use the dyke inflation parameters found by Takeoetal. [2006] and later corroborated by Aoki et al. [2013]. It is worth noting that Takagi et al. [2005] and Takeoetal. [2006] both include two small magma reservoirs along the magma ascent path; however, we found that their stress contribution had little effect on the regional stress conditions with respect to the dyke stress contribution. Noninclusion of these reser- voirs, located at 1.5 and 2.2 km below sea level [ Takagi et al. , 2005], means that raypaths traveling close to the caldera of Asama may be poorly modeled. 2.6. Regional Stress Any consideration of stress-induced anisotropy would be incomplete without the inclusion of the effects of the regional stress field. In this paper, the regional stress field will refer to the combined effects of confin- ing pressure and tectonic forces. We assume the regional stress to be constant through time, in contrast to the stress field exerted by the volcano. Interaction between regional stress and local stresses from magma emplacement is a central theme in interpreting seismic anisotropy changes during volcanic eruptions [e.g., Gerst and Savage , 2004; Johnson et al. , 2011]. Roman and Heron [2007] studied the link between the distri- bution of volcano-tectonic earthquakes (VT) and Coulomb stress modeling of dyke inflation, finding that VT c(""Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth"", ""10.1002/2013JB010817"", ""Table 2."", ""Elastic Properties for Rocks With Dry and"", ""Wet-Filled Cracks Given by"", ""Crampin"", ""[1985]"", ""a"", ""Dry Cracks"", ""c"", ""1111"", ""="", ""51"", ""."", ""546"", ""c"", ""2222"", ""="", ""83"", ""."", ""477"", ""c"", ""3333"", ""="", ""83"", ""."", ""477"", ""c"", ""1122"", ""="", ""17"", ""."", ""175"", ""c"", ""2233"", ""="", ""25"", ""."", ""155"", ""c"", ""3311"", ""="", ""17"", ""."", ""175"", ""c"", ""1212"", ""="", ""23"", ""."", ""240"", ""c"", ""2323"", ""="", ""29"", ""."", ""161"", ""c"", ""3131"",

Anisotropy Model Testing We tested the forward model by using effective elastic constants for both dry and fluid-filled cracked media given by Crampin [1985] (shown in Table 2) as a benchmark. To do this, an arbi- trary ray path configuration with a range of event-station azimuths and incidence angles was created (see Figure 3). In each case, there is a set of cracks dipping vertically, striking east-west. The forward model was configured to Figure 3. Ray path configuration used in the test cases. All ray paths have a assign the same elastic constants to length of 20 km and are positioned to have straight-line surface incidence     every model block. As can be seen in angles at 15 intervals from 0 to 75 at back azimuths in 30 intervals. The surface of the model is at 4 km. Figure 4, the forward model was able to faithfully recreate the results that Crampin made in 1985. Similar tests were done with the stiffness matrix rotated in order to represent cracks with planes parallel to the horizontal. They display a tangential arrangement of polarizations with delay times increasing with larger incidence angles for dry cracks and a more complex pattern for saturated cracks showing a polarization flip between radial directions at low incidence angles and tangential directions for rays that are more steeply inclined to the plane of the cracks. In order to produce a comparable forward model using the stress-induced anisotropy calculations, a 50 km by 50 km by 34 km model space was created with a uniaxial stress of 12.5 MPa oriented east-west. As before, a range of equidistant event/station pairs were used in order to observe the splitting effects in a range of azimuths and incidence angles. As can be seen in Figure 5, the results are the same morphologically as the dry cracks shown in Figure 4, except that fast directions are rotated toward the tangential near the North and South Poles. As the derivation of the stiffness matrix for Figure 5 is based on the assumption that the Figure 4.

Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2013JB010817 cracks are dry and noninteractive, we expect the observed similar- ities in comparative delay times and fast directions for this raypath configuration. 3.2. Stress Model Analysis In order to investigate any relationship between ray path, dyke stress, and shear wave splitting, we calculated stress models derived from the known dyke and material properties at Mount Asama and compared the dyke stress along various event ray- paths to the respective shear wave splitting measurements. Dyke stresses were considered independently of gravitational and tec- tonic forces, since in this case we are exclusively assessing the Figure 5.

This type of analysis can be done east-west direction.

Data 1 76 , crack closing pressure P = 19 2 MPa, c  = 20 GPa, and K = 50 GPa. from Savage et al. [2010] were analyzed in this way. Here we show results from 32 regional events measured at station AVO between January 2004 and December 2005 and 35 local events that occurred between June 2004 and February 2005. In particular, we discuss results from AVO due to the orig- inal study observing a high degree of correlation between splitting measurements made there over time and ground deformation over the period spanning the eruption. Stresses for a dyke opening model alone were unrealistically large, as high as 100 MPa at the dyke edges. Such high stresses are an artifact of the application of a uniform opening on the dyke plane in the model. Figure 6 shows the extent of the stress magnitudes, which decrease quickly with distance from the dyke face to roughly 10 MPa at less than 1 km from the dyke. Elastic parameters for the model were determined from the seismic velocity model of Aoki et al. [2009]. Results for regional events recorded at AVO and local events show no correlation between the dyke stress felt along the raypath and delay time. At station AVO, the strongest dyke stress conditions for the majority of the raypaths were felt at the depth of the dyke, between 3 and 5 km deep. Results for regional events arriving at AVO (see Figure 6) experience maximum compres- sive dyke stresses of 1.0Â­1.1 MPa, and local raypaths (see Figure 7) experience similar maximum compressive dyke stresses of 0.9Â­1.1 MPa. Dyke stresses were added to regional stress backgrounds during the stress model regridding process. In each case, the regional stress followed a one-dimensional relationship with depth. Isotropic stress increases - 3 with depth (where we assumed a constant density of 3000 kg m in the relationship), as does deviatoric     stresses with and being 2.5%, 5%, and 10% higher and lower, respectively, than .

Elastic Tensor The elastic tensor of each block is the governing parameter for seismic velocity and therefore central to the results taken from this modeling. Taking the calculations from Hudson [1981] for both dry and fluid-filled cracks, synthetic splitting measurements were calculated for a range of crack densities and stress mod- els. For the stress model, dyke stresses were added to regional stress backgrounds during the stress model regridding process, as discussed in section 3.2. We tested the effects of using various forward models incorporating Hudson's elastic parameters on the data set of 35 local events, comprising 86 individual station-event pairs (see Figure 7). Results for both dry and fluid-filled crack models show that synthetic fast directions were poorly aligned with measurements   regardless of , with a mean model-measurement misfit of 45Â­55 (see Figure 9). Increasing crack density made little impact on fast direction, as the orientation of anisotropy is consistent while using the same stress  model. Savage et al. [2010] found misfits of 38Â­52 in a simple comparison between the measurements and stress directions found from Coulomb stress modeling of the dyke, as well as the two inflating magma  chambers of Takagi et al. [2005]. Here delay times were best modeled with values of 0.04Â­0.08, depending on the stress model used and whether dry or fluid-filled crack equations were employed. For the best fit- ting models the root mean square error of delay times was around 0.1 s, similar to the mean measured delay time for the events (see Figure 9). As this approach assumes a constant crack density throughout the model, we found that there was a broad correlation between length of raypath and modeled delay times. Such a correlation, however, is not present in the measured data. Comparisons between different models were made by calculating the mean difference between two sets of results, such as  N | | 1 2 x - x i i i 1 = Mean difference (7) = N where i is each individual measurement. Mean angular differences in fast direction between models having   a regional stress where was 5% larger than (the smallest modeled) with and without the dyke added 1 3 c(""Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth"", ""10.1002/2013JB010817"", ""Figure 10."", ""A comparison of mean differences between modeled results.

Discussion Using Hudson's calculations to derive elastic tensors gave the best fitting results at crack densities very sim- . 2 - ilar to that found by Savage et al. [2010] from local earthquakes (4 4 10 ). Errors between the model and Ã— measurements were relatively large; however, the mean delay times were similar for models at the above  crack density. We observe that the modeled fast direction RMS misfits are in the region of 10 larger than misfits found by the original study using comparisons between Coulomb modeling and fast directions. The same forward models also displayed more sensitivity to regional stresses than to inclusion of the dyke itself. This suggests that accurately defining the background stress conditions is an important step to a more comprehensive understanding of the interaction between volcanic stresses and anisotropy. In models using the full analytic solution for dry crack anisotropy, modeled delay times were extremely low in comparison to measurements. Using a dry crack model such as this will necessarily underestimate the degree of anisotropy because lower stress conditions are needed to close an air-filled void than to close voids saturated with fluids which are near incompressible (i.e., water). This is due to Sayers and Kachang 's [1995] original formulae for brittle rock anisotropy making an approximation that assumes a high normal crack compliance. If the cracks are filled with a fluid and there is microscale fluid flow between them, this could have strong implications for modeling stress-induced anisotropy. Wave-induced flow between cracks will affect dispersion and attenuation [ Chapman et al. , 2002; Gurevich et al. , 2010], as well as anisotropy [ Collet and Gurevich , 2013]. On a longer time scale, this fluid flow may create conditions in which relatively small levels of differential stress can produce significant changes in anisotropy. This was concluded by Zatsepin and Crampin [1997], who posit that hydraulically isolated sets of fluid-filled cracks may exist to depths of many kilometers. Our models show that variations in anisotropy around volcanoes as dyke stresses quickly become small compared to expected lithostatic pressure, with or without a regional stress (see Figure 7). Thus, if stress-induced anisotropy caused the measured changes at Asama [ Savage et al. , 2010], then hydraulic interaction between cracks is likely to have occurred. A small differential stress, when applied to such a system, will produce a pressure gradient along which fluid migration can occur from cracks oriented perpendicularly to maximum compressive stress to those aligned otherwise. This results in excess pore fluid pressure within the crack that is dependent on differential stress and the relative orientation of the crack [ Zatsepin and Crampin , 1997]. If the fluid is near incompressible, the total crack volume in the medium will not be significantly changed. Fluid under pressure entrained in cracks at depth will also prevent their closure despite increasing lithostatic pressure, provided no upward macroscale fluid diffusion can occur. The above consideration is approximated by the approach using Hudson's formulations for fluid-filled cracks, as strength of anisotropy does not depend on differential stress magnitudes. However, it is unlikely that the strength of anisotropy is constant and, as evidenced by the unsatisfactory model fit, that it is entirely controlled by principal stress orientation. Strength of anisotropy may be strongly affected by the lithology and formation and deformation history of the rock, as well as other features such as other stress sources, fractures, mineral fabrics, and rock unit interfaces. 4.1. Considerations for Future Work A logical development to this method is to use measurements made outside a volcano's active period to invert for anisotropic structure (using methods such as that of Abt and Fischer [2008] or Wookey [2012] and then applying a model such as Hudson 's [1981) or the APE model of Zatsepin and Crampin [1997] to find properties of the rock mass (e.g., crack density) from that. Providing a ""background"" model of anisotropy in this way could be key to setting a benchmark from which subsequent measurements can be compared. This would potentially not only provide more robustness in using shear wave splitting as an eruption-forecasting tool but also help to elucidate the source of temporally changing anisotropy as changes would be relative to what we already believe to be present. This is most important when attempting to interpret changes in measured anisotropy, especially when trying to forecast volcanic activity as data may be sparse. As volcanic eruptions are often accompanied by changes to the spatial distribution and intensity of the vol- canic hydrothermal system, changing fluid properties (both physical and chemical) could be a mechanism for dynamic anisotropy conditions associated with volcanic activity. Fluid flow and gas emission are very much affected by thermal conditions and subsurface permeability, in addition to changing stress proper- ties. Studies on the stress-dependent compliance properties of volcanic rocks would be useful to investigate these effects. Detecting such changes can feasibly be done with seismic methods; V  V can be a proxy p s for fluid or gas saturation [ Wang et al. , 2012]. Johnson and Poland [2013] identified changes in shear wave Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2013JB010817 splitting measurements and V V at Mount KÂ¯ilauea associated with degassing of SO rather than changes  p s 2 in stress. Angerer et al. [2002], using the anisotropic poro-elastic (APE) model of Zatsepin and Crampin [1997], studied the effect of changing fluid pressure on crack content, seismic velocity, and anisotropy of a dolomite  reservoir, finding S wave anisotropy changes of 5.8% after injection of high-pressure CO ,aswell asa90 flip 2 in fast polarization to become stress-perpendicular. Changes in anisotropy not due to stress changes should also be addressed. Dynamic changes of mate- rial filling cracks, and therefore their elastic properties, were not modeled here, although they may have a substantial effect on resultant anisotropy through the influences explained above. The aforementioned ana- lytical solution only considers the bulk and shear moduli of the intact, isotropic rock. Naturally, the effective bulk and shear moduli of the resulting anisotropic material are changed depending on the distribution of open cracks. The solution for the anisotropic term in the stiffness tensor is factored by radial and tangential crack compliances; however, the ratio between these compliances is poorly defined. Gurevich et al. [2011] . give the ratio B  B = 1 76 as found from fitting the rock physics model outlined in Angus et al. [2009] to N T results from tests made on a sample of Barre Granite. The same study by Angus et al. [2009] applied their fit- ting method to data on sedimentary rocks, finding that compliance ratios range between 0.0 and 2.0 and cluster around 0.6. In addition to microscale fluid flow, the contents of the microcracks are expected to alter B  B , as the change in compressibility of the fluid or gas in the crack will have a disproportionate effect of N T the normal compliance over the tangential compliance. Sayers and Han [2002] and especially Angus et al. [2012], while studying sedimentary rocks, find that ratios in dry samples and saturated samples are indeed different. Angus et al. [2012] showed that crack saturation had the effect of tightly clustering ratios around 0.5, in comparison to dry samples that showed ratios distributed between 0.4 and 2.0. There is also the issue of the crack compliance value itself, which can significantly affect model results (see Figure 12). These complications present a challenge when attempting to model complex anisotropic systems. Finally, we have modeled the dyke emplacement using an elastic finite element method, which offers bet- ter control over the model space (i.e., the geometry of the dyke interface and surface topography) than Coulomb stress modeling. As already mentioned, viscoelastic deformation near the magma pathway would likely increase the needed pressure to produce the observed surface deformation. The converse of this is that viscoelastic deformation in an aureole around the dyke will act to reduce the magnitude of the static stress field. Currently it is difficult to quantify the combined effect on anisotropy of both stress and viscoelas- tic deformation. Furthermore, during the dyke emplacement process the stress state will evolve in a different way to modeling whole-dyke inflation, as has been done in our method. As a dyke is emplaced, magma overpressure is greatest at the edge that is propagating through country rock, producing large, localized stress magnitudes [ Taisne et al. , 2011], which may significantly alter the stress profile of the region."

Conclusion We have developed a method for three-dimensional modeling of shear wave splitting in the crust and applied this model to the 2004 eruption at Mount Asama, Japan, in order to investigate the link between the crack closure model of stress-induced anisotropy and observed measurements. Results showed that dyke stresses are small relative to overall stress conditions expected from the rock overburden at depth. We found that applying both a simplistic measure of crack anisotropy and an analytic dry crack anisotropy relationship that takes into account the stress state produced variations in both strength and orientation of anisotropy smaller than those observed during the eruption. We also observe that for the dyke to have a significant effect on the anisotropy, the deviatoric regional stress must be small with the magnitude of   being less than 5% greater than . However, the dynamic rupture process of the dyke during its ascent 1 3 will concentrate stress at the edge of propagation due to magma accumulation, meaning that we may be underestimating dyke stresses during emplacement. From these findings we conclude that dry crack clo- sure due to dyke-induced stress changes is not a candidate for changing anisotropy conditions. This would suggest a number of possible alternatives, given that the possibility that changes in splitting measurements represent spatial heterogeneity in anisotropy was addressed by Savage et al. [2010]. The process for creat- ing anisotropy may be different from the one used in the model; for example, the APE model of Zatsepin and Crampin [1997], where very small changes in the deviatoric stress component can produce relatively large changes in crack anisotropy, could be applicable. Alternatively, there may be a process associated with the volcanism that changes the crack properties themselves, in terms of either their distribution or overall contribution to anisotropy such as changing properties in fluid or gas pressure and saturation."

Asthenospheric shear is driven by lithospheric plates with different thicknesses moving at Â­  3 9 cm/yr, and the initial low viscosity region is a rectangularly shaped pocket with an imposed viscosity that is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the surrounding asthenosphere. Melting decreases as the pocket deforms and reaches steady state after Â­ 3 12 Myr. The age progression of surface volcanism is nearly stationary in the reference frame of the plate, which distinguishes SDU from hot spot volcanism. Similar behavior occurs if the viscosity heterogeneity is induced by variations in the water content ' of mantle peridotite. If the pocket s low viscosity is caused by excess temperature, buoyant upwelling of the entire pocket dominates volcanism. Differences in the time dependence of volcanism associated with damp and warm pockets may help identify which type of mantle heterogeneity and associated dynamic process best explains weak, intermittent, intraplate volcanism with no obvious age progression. We suggest that asthenospheric shear induced by plate motions and global mantle flow, by exciting SDU, Â­  drives some of the non hot spot small scale volcanism that occurs away from plate boundaries.

25 bianco jgrb16872.pdf,I,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Introduction [ ] Although there are many examples of intraplate vol- 2 ' canism on Earth s continents and ocean floor, the origin of much of this volcanism is not well explained. Currently, the most successful explanation for the formation of intraplate volcanism is the thermal plume hypothesis, by which warm, buoyant material rises from some depth in the mantle, and the excess temperature of the plume allows for melting away from plate boundaries [ Wilson , 1963; Morgan , 1971, 1972]. The plume hypothesis makes a number of predictions, such as the existence of flood basalts formed by the plume head [ Morgan , 1971; Whitehead and Luther , 1975; Richards et al. , "" "" 1989], the eruption of a hot spot trail of volcanoes with an age progression formed by plate motion, topographic swells 1 Department of Geological Sciences, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA. 2 Department of Geology and Geophysics, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA. 3 Department of Geoscience, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.

[ ] Of the thousands of confirmed examples of intraplate 3 volcanism across the globe and in the geological record, the number that are clearly the result of thermal, plumelike anomalies is on the order of tens, and these tend to be the most voluminous examples of intraplate magmatism [ Courtillot et al. , 2003; Ito and van Keken , 2007]. Of course, there is a lack of data in many instances to rule out a plume source,  but many well studied island chains lack one or more of the major features predicted by the plume hypothesis [ Courtillot et al. , 2003]. One of the most compelling reasons to reject a plume source for intraplate volcanism is the lack of an  obvious hot spot age progression in the spatial temporal pattern of eruptions. Examples of intraplate volcanism without an age progression consistent with plate motion over a fixed plume include the Line Islands, Marshall Islands, and 1of 17 c(""B11103"", ""BIANCO ET AL.: TIME DEPENDENCE OF SDU VOLCANISM"", ""Cameroon Line, and even more classical examples such as"", """", """", """", ""Samoa and the Puka"", ""Puka ridge have less"", ""than"", ""perfect age"", ""progressions throughout their durations ["", ""Ito and van Keken"", "","", ""2007].

Such time dependent constraints are essential in order to evaluate the viability of SDU as a gen- erator of intraplate volcanism, and to make quantitative predictions about SDU age progression that can be compared against observations. Testing the persistence of SDU is particularly important because Conrad et al. [2010] assumed  only rectangular shaped pockets, which may not be repre- sentative of actual asthenospheric heterogeneity (although some tomographic studies show that heterogeneity can be boxy in cross section [e.g., Gao et al. , 2004; West et al. , 2004]), particularly because pocket shape must be continu- ously changing when exposed to asthenospheric shear.   [ ] Here we present 2 D, time dependent models of SDU 6 for the second type of lateral viscosity variation examined  by Conrad et al. [2010]: low viscosity pockets embedded within a shearing asthenospheric layer. These simulations simultaneously solve for viscous flow patterns and melting of a peridotite source. We predict the rate of melting and volcanic emplacement of melt at the surface, the duration of volcanism, and the spatial and temporal patterns of eruption. We determine which parameters, such as the dimensions of pockets, the thickness of plates, and the magnitude of shear, control the time dependence of SDU. To explore these parameters, we start simply by examining pockets in which low viscosity is simply imposed (i.e., with no specific nat- ural explanation). Next we examine more realistic causes of low viscosity within these pockets, specifically variations in water content [e.g., Michael , 1988; Dixon et al. , 2002, 2004; Asimow and Langmuir , 2003] or temperature. Finally, we  compare this robust description of time dependent SDU melting simulations to observations of intraplate volcanism on continents and the seafloor."

The dimensionless height of a pocket, H , is the dimensional LV height of the pocket divided by the height of the astheno- sphere, H . The dimensionless width of a pocket, W ,is Asth LV ' defined in the same manner, and pocket s aspect ratio is W / H . LV LV  [ ] In the case of an imposed pocket, our tracer advection 15 u scheme interpolates the premultiplier, , from the tracers to the nodes between advection steps. Once this information is at the nodal level, CITCOM can correctly include the viscosity heterogeneity. We initialize tracers inside the pocket with u u = 0.01 and outside the pocket with = 1.0. We refer to  this low viscosity heterogeneity as an imposed pocket, as we have imposed a drop in viscosity that is not related to any particular physical variation in the asthenosphere. u [ ] In the case of a damp pocket, must be calculated at 16 the nodal level from other information. We assume that water behaves like an incompatible trace element and is partitioned between solid and melt by modal, fractional melting such that 1 = D Ã€ 1 H O H O C Â¼ C 1 Ã€ F Ã°Ãž ; Ã° 7 Ãž 2 2 s o H O where C is the concentration of water in the solid residue, 2 s H O C is the initial concentration, and D is the bulk partition 2 o coefficient.

We inter- H O polate C from the tracers to the nodes between advection 2 o steps, and compute (7) and (8) at the node level. In the H O H O simulations below, C = 400 ppm (i.e., C inside the 2 2 P o H O pocket), and C 2 = 0 outside the pocket. The 2 orders of o magnitude decrease in viscosity between hydrous peridotite with 400 ppm water and anhydrous peridotite captures rhe- ological observations from laboratory experiments [ Chopra and Paterson , 1984; Karato et al. , 1986; Borch and Green ,1989; Mei and Kohlstedt , 2000; Jung and Karato , 2001]."
25 bianco jgrb16872.pdf,RD,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Heterogeneity [ ] We first discuss simulations of SDU in which we 17 impose viscosity heterogeneity. We thus initially ignore the (hydrous or thermal) cause of the viscosity heterogeneity, which allows us to examine the time dependence of SDU generally before examining the specific effects of water or temperature.  3.1. Patterns of Shear Driven Upwelling [ ] To demonstrate the flow and melting patterns that arise 18 from SDU, we first consider four example cases of lateral viscosity variations exposed to viscous shear (Figure 1). In an isoviscous scenario, vertical velocity everywhere is zero, and 4of17 B11103 material moving to the right is replaced by material from the "" "" left. However, if the shear flow encounters a wall shaped viscosity decrease (a step function decrease of 2 orders of magnitude in viscosity), then the viscosity heterogeneity can induce a component of vertical flow (Figure 1b). In particular,  we find that the lower viscosity material moving to the right  is most easily replaced by low viscosity material from below,  rather than by the higher viscosity material upstream. Thus, we find plane Couette flow (and zero vertical velocity) far from the viscosity transition, but upwelling vertical velocity  on the low viscosity side of the viscosity transition (Figure 1a). We also find that upwelling occurring downstream of the viscosity transition is fed by material coming from the left, which induces a large downward velocity along, and on both sides of, the viscosity wall (Figure 1a).  [ ] In a second example, we isolate the low viscosity 19 material to a 320 km wide rectangular pocket (Figure 1c). The vertical velocity profile across this transition is similar to the wall case (Figure 1a), but the upwellings on both sides of the pocket edge are amplified compared to the wall case, and the downwelling at the pocket wall is diminished because the height of the pocket is limited. The upwelling is enhanced because of circulation that is induced within the pocket by the shear flow. This circulation, which was described by Conrad et al. [2010], occurs because shear  becomes concentrated within the center of the low viscosity pocket, and upwelling on the upstream side of the pocket is required to feed the faster velocity along the top of the pocket (Figure 1c). The vertical velocity profile is reflected and inverted about the center of the pocket, thus inducing downwelling both inside and outside of the downstream side of the pocket, and local upwelling along the downstream pocket wall. [ ] For alternative pocket shapes of similar dimension, 20 we observe the same basic pattern of upwelling and downwelling. If the walls of the pocket are semicircular (Figure 1d) rather than vertical, the vertical velocity pattern is similar to the rectangular pocket (Figure 1c), although the  vertical velocity amplitudes are reduced by 50% (Figure 1a). ""  "" Similarly, a pocket with right leaning walls (Figure 1e) also shows a similar pattern of vertical flows (Figure 1a), although the slanting wall causes the interior and exterior pocket upwellings to merge, which eliminates localized downwelling along the vertical pocket boundary (Figure 1a). [ ] These simulations confirm a general prediction of 21 previous work, which found that under shear, lateral varia-  tions in viscosity induce SDU within low viscosity pockets on their upstream sides [ Conrad et al. , 2010]. The above examples additionally demonstrate a second region of less  intense upwelling occurring outside of the low viscosity  pocket. This outside pocket upwelling is separated from the  interior pocket upwelling by a downwelling when the pocket wall is nearly vertical. We observe an inverted pattern near downstream walls, which includes a minor upwelling along a nearly vertical wall that separates two regions of down- welling flow (Figure 1a). Other simulations have confirmed these basic patterns for a wide range of lateral viscosity variations, including a variety of shapes and viscosity gra- dients, although we do not discuss the details those experi-  ments here.

""velocity increase vertical velocity, which increases the"", ""instantaneous thickening rate (but decreases the duration of"", ""melting, as shown above). Increasing the pocket aspect ratio"", ""also increases the vertical velocity (or has only a weak"", ""affect), and likewise may increase instantaneous thickening"", ""rate.

"", 2010] did not"", ""31"", ""examine the potential for melting outside of the pocket. In that"", ""location, upwelling flow is generated by the presence of the"", ""pocket viscosity heterogeneity, but does not significantly"", ""'"", ""depend on the pocket"", ""s shape. Because the pocket itself"", ""persists over time, melting upstream from the pocket is rel-"", ""atively steady and the associated thickening rate at the surface"", ""is also relatively steady over the duration of our simulations."", ""Thickening rate upstream from the pocket increases linearly"", 
""_"", ""&quot;"", ""with"", ""and decreases with the depth of the pocket relative to"", ""the surface. Additionally, thickening the mechanical litho-"", ""sphere inhibits circulation around the top of the pocket, which"", """", ""decreases the thickening rate (see Figure 5b, after"", ""6 Myr)."", ""["", ""] The cumulative thickening above the pocket is"", ""32"", ""affected by both the duration of melting and the instantaneous"", ""thickening rate.

""V"", "", but the time scale of"", ""plate"", ""pocket melting decreases with"", ""V"", "", making the cumulative"", ""plate"", ""thickness above the pocket relatively insensitive to"", ""V"", ""plate"", ""(Figure 6a). When varying the parameters of plate thickness,"", ""pocket aspect ratio, and pocket depth, the predicted time"", ""9of17"") B11103 scale, thickening rate, and consequently cumulative thick- Â­ ening, increase together (Figures 6b 6d). Time scale is not a factor for the steady melting zone outside of the pocket; only thickening rate is important to the cumulative thickness away from the pocket. Thus increasing plate velocity, increasing aspect ratio, decreasing pocket depth, and decreasing the mechanical or thermal lithospheric thickness all tend to  increase outside pocket cumulative thickness. In general, cumulative thickness is most sensitive to the height of the melting column, which is controlled by pocket depth, plate thickness, and plate age in our tests, but also by other factors we have not tested such as, mineralogy, T and other ther- p modynamic parameters. At 10 Myr, melting outside the  Â­ pocket produces an erupted thickness between 0.5 2.0 km at the surface, and melting inside the pocket produces a  Â­ 1.0 4.0 km thick layer. Simulations With Realistic Viscosity Variations  [ ] So far, we have induced shear driven upwelling by 33 simply imposing low viscosities within asthenospheric pockets without considering the source of the astheno- spheric heterogeneity that is responsible for the low viscos-  ities. The most likely causes of low viscosity heterogeneity are regional changes in the water content or temperature of asthenospheric rocks, which can produce larger viscosity variations compared to other factors such as grain size var- iations and melt retention [see, e.g., Hirth and Kohlstedt , 2003, Table 1]. However, under some conditions, melt   retention may cause order of magnitude variations in vis-  cosity if high porosity melt channels form [e.g., Kohlstedt et al. , 2010]. While both water and heat can decrease rock viscosity, and therefore can excite SDU in the presence of asthenospheric shear, both also induce changes in the upwelling and/or melting behavior that can affect volumes and patterns of surface volcanism. 4.1. Damp Pockets [ ] We introduce a hydrous source for the 2 orders of 34 magnitude viscosity decrease within the pocket by following the procedure described in section 2.2. For imposed low c(""viscosities, the duration of melting and the surface eruption"", ""pattern are predominantly controlled by asthenospheric"", ""strain rates, and, to a lesser extent, the shape and dimensions"", ""of the pocket (Figure 4). Water content in the pocket does"", ""not significantly affect these parameters, and thus does not"", ""greatly influence the duration of volcanism. The rate of"", ""melting, however, which is expressed at the surface by"", ""thickening rate, is predominantly controlled by the height"", ""and productivity of the melting column (Figures 5"", 
""Â­"", ""6), and"", ""these properties are affected by water content."", ""["", ""35"", ""] One might expect that progressive melting inside the"", ""damp pocket should dehydrate the peridotite, increase the"", ""viscosity or decrease the size of the pocket, and conse-"", ""quently should shorten the measured time scale of melting"", ""inside the pocket. However, the simulations predict no"", ""significant difference in time scale between imposed and"", ""damp pockets. The dynamics modeled here and in the work"", ""of"",

Thus melting patterns in this scenario are dominated by buoyant upwelling, and only modified slightly by SDU (Figure 7c). h [ ] For all and E , cases with SDU (i.e., moving plates) 42 o a   have thicker crust after 1 Myr (Figure 8a). This extra SDU induced thickness increases with E , but is insensitive to the a   h order of magnitude range of examined here because SDU o circulation amplifies with viscosity contrast, rather than with absolute viscosity. However, the background melting caused by buoyant spreading beneath the plate varies by an order of D r h magnitude because it is sensitive to / . Therefore, the o relative amplification of total erupted thickness generated h by SDU increases with (Figure 8a). Thus, SDU melting o h in warm pockets is significant in simulations with &gt; o  h  20 19 10 Pa s, but insignificant if &lt; 10 Pa s. This initial o augmentation of melting due to SDU, however, is usually followed by a period of relative suppression of melting after a few million years (Figure 8b), likely because shearing eventually deforms the pocket into a shape that is not conducive to either SDU or efficient spreading. [ ] Given the predictions above, we can assume that there 43 h is an optimal set of conditions (e.g., pocket shape, , E , o a v ) that maximizes the relative importance of SDU for the plate dynamics and melting of a warm pocket. However, for warm h  20 pockets at asthenospheric conditions (e.g., 10 Pa s), o  SDU is likely to exert second order importance. Discussion [ ] Our calculations have shown that SDU is a viable 44 process for generating or increasing asthenospheric melting for viscosity heterogeneities that are related to elevated water content, temperature, or other factors. To determine whether SDU melting might actually generate intraplate volcanism on Earth, we compare predictions from our cal- culations to several observed aspects of intraplate volca- nism. Most commonly, intraplate volcanism is classified by eruption rate, duration or age range, spatial and temporal patterns, geochemistry, and the association of the volcanism with geophysical observations such as the presence of a c(""topographic swell or a thermal anomaly in the mantle [e.g.,"", ""Ito and van Keken"", "", 2007]. With the simulations presented"", ""above, we can make comparisons to observed eruption rates,"", ""durations, and spatial and temporal patterns. We focus on"", ""the damp and warm pockets, which have rheologies based"", ""on experimental results."", ""["", ""45"", ""] Examples of intraplate volcanism exist throughout"", ""the western United States. Many of these volcanic fields,"", ""particularly throughout the Basin and Range and Colorado"", 
""Plateau, have relatively low eruption volumes and rates,"", ""represent short durations, and do not collectively form an"", ""obvious hot spot track.

There are, however, many sea- mounts that can be equally well explained by melting in a damp pocket that is experiencing SDU, particularly those formed on young plates where SDU would generate the most magma. Our calculations show that damp pockets beneath thin, young plates (&lt;10 km thick) produce a maximum  thickening rate of 0.3 km/Myr and a sustained thickening  3 3 rate of 0.1 km/Myr. To form a seamount volume of 10 km in 1 Myr with these rates, the seamount would have form from  Â­ a source area with a 32 56 km radius. Simulations with  damp pockets that have dimensions of 100 km do predict that SDU can generate a source volume of this size, but  efficiently transporting magma 30 to 50 km beneath such a thin plate may be difficult [ Hieronymus and Bercovici , 2001]. More voluminous seamounts, and seamounts that form on plates thicker than 10 km require a larger source radius, and may be better explained by a thermal anomaly, or may require some combination of thermal or chemical heterogeneity to augment SDU melting, as discussed above. Seamounts of  2 3  10 km that have erupted in 1 Myr require a source radius  Â­ of only 10 18 km, which is a reasonable a source radius for thin plates [ Hieronymus and Bercovici , 2001]. [ ] The overall implication of our study is that SDU can 54 Â­ induce the melting necessary to form some of the small, non hot spot, intraplate volcanism observed on both the con- tinents and seafloor. Larger volcanic fields, such as Iceland or Hawaii, still likely require a thermal explanation. Our simulations predict that small, anomalous volcanism should preferentially form on continental or oceanic areas that lie above rapidly shearing asthenosphere. This prediction was investigated by Conrad et al. [2011], who found a positive correlation between mantle shear and the occurrence of intraplate basaltic volcanism. Shear rate, the shapes and magnitudes of sublithospheric viscosity heterogeneities, and asthenospheric temperature should all exert controls on the formation of anomalous volcanism by SDU."
25 bianco jgrb16872.pdf,C,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Conclusions [ ] Shear in the asthenosphere can excite circulatory flow 55 within a variety of types of viscosity heterogeneities. In the  case of low viscosity pockets embedded in the ambient asthenosphere, the vertical component of this circulation, ""  "" known as shear driven upwelling (SDU) causes melting if the upwelling occurs within material near its solidus, such as uncooled (i.e., at the ambient T ) material that was emplaced p  by passive upwelling beneath a mid ocean ridge. One robust "" ""  model prediction is that shearing of an imposed low viscosity pocket induces a strong melting zone near the upstream side of the pocket and a broad circulation around the pocket that generates a separate melting zone further upstream, beyond the pocket boundaries. A second robust prediction is that these two melting zones move nearly at the same velocity as plate motion (except in special cases with deep pockets or thin asthenosphere [see also Anderson , 2010]), making them nearly stationary on the plate. Thus,  SDU induced volcanism features little or no age progression at the surface, which distinguishes it from volcanism induced by mantle plumes. c(""B11103"", ""BIANCO ET AL.: TIME DEPENDENCE OF SDU VOLCANISM"", """", ""["", ""] For low"", ""viscosity pockets that are initially rectangu-"", ""56"", ""lar, eruption of melt from upstream of the pocket remains"", ""relatively steady with time, while eruption of melt generated"", """", ""Â­"", ""within the pocket decreases over a time scale of"", ""2"", ""12 Myr."", ""This time scale decreases with, and is most sensitive to,"", ""_"", ""&quot;"", ""asthenospheric strain rate"", ""(i.e.,"", ""V"", ""/"", ""H"", ""), but also tends"", ""plate"",

[ ] In a previous paper [ Sutherland et al. , 2010], we 3 presented observations of anomalous topography and sub- sidence, showed that a simplified geodynamic model of mantle upwelling could be constructed to fit all observa- tions, and we proposed a hypothesis that such an upwelling  may have followed the Cretaceous termination of long lived subduction (&gt;200 Myr) at the Gondwana margin. In this paper, we document and analyze a range of geodynamic models for the evolving mantle flow, and hence we are able to draw conclusions about mantle properties. Our models incorporate mantle upwellings and a downwelling that are geometrically simplified, and are required to evolve to fea- tures equivalent to the three anomalous velocity structures  imaged in global seismic tomographic inversions, and we must fit observations of geoid, topography, and subsidence history from 80 Ma to the present.  [ ] First, we utilize global time dependent geodynamic 4 models to constrain the magnitude of buoyancy anomalies and their initial Late Cretaceous geometry and depth. Second,   we fit time dependent (tectonic subsidence) and present day (geoid, seismic tomography and residual bathymetry) observations jointly, to constrain both the relative and  absolute values of mantle viscosities in the ANT NZ region. 1of 16 c(""B05402"", ""SPASOJEVIC ET AL.: ANTARCTICA-NEW ZEALAND DYNAMIC MODELS"", ""Figure 1."", ""Cartoons showing the configuration of Australia,"", ""Antarctica, New Zealand and the Campbell Plateau (CAM)"", ""at a time (a) when Gondwana had an active subduction zone"", ""and arc and (b) when incipient development of the Tasman"", ""Sea and South Pacific Ocean during widespread rifting led"", ""to final Gondwana breakup.

Third, we investigate the association of the observed ANT geoid low with mantle upwelling, which makes this region of particular geodynamic interest, because upwellings are more usually associated with geoid highs [ Richards et al. , 1988]. Tectonic History  [ ] The ANT NZ region today has conjugate passive 5 margins that are separated by seafloor spreading at the  Pacific Antarctic Rise [ Cande et al. , 1995; Molnar et al. , 1975], but it was previously a region characterized by a  long lived subduction zone that was active over much of the Late Paleozoic and Mesozoic [ Adams et al. , 2007; Mortimer et al. , 1999; Veevers , 2000]. Mesozoic activity along the eastern Gondwana subduction zone (Figure 1) occurred from offshore eastern Australia, New Caledonia, and the Lord Howe Rise [ Adams et al. , 2007; Mortimer et al. , 1998; Paris , 1981; Veevers et al. , 1994], through New Zealand and the Chatham Rise [ Bradshaw , 1989; Davy et al. , 2008; Kimbrough et al. , 1994; Mortimer et al. , 1999], to Marie Byrd Land in Antarctica [ Bradshaw et al. , 1997; Mukasa and Dalziel , 2000; Weaver et al. , 1994]. Subduction con- tinued during the Cenozoic in the Thurston Island and Antarctic Peninsula regions [ Cunningham et al. , 2002; Dalziel and Elliot , 1982; Larter et al. , 2002; Storey and Nell , 1988], and the subduction zone is still active today in western South America [ Allmendinger et al. , 1997; Herve et al. , 2007]. [ ] The termination of subduction was earliest in the New 6  Zealand sector, where the youngest subduction related  Â­ igneous rocks formed at 115 105 Ma [ Kimbrough et al. , 1994; Mortimer et al. , 1999; Muir et al. , 1995, 1998; Waight et al. , 1998], and this time corresponds to the end of local convergent deformation [ Mazengarb and Harris , 1994] and the onset of widespread rifting and intraplate  (anorogenic, A type) magmatism [ Laird and Bradshaw , 2004; Weaver et al. , 1994]. Subduction termination was  Â­ slightly later at 105 95 Ma in Marie Byrd Land [ Bradshaw et al. , 1997; Mukasa and Dalziel , 2000; Storey et al. , 1999], and was not until Cenozoic time (&lt;65 Ma) in the Thurston Island and Antarctic Peninsula regions [ Cunningham et al. , 2002; Larter et al. , 2002; McCarron and Larter , 1998; Storey and Nell , 1988]. [ ] Gondwana breakup and voluminous magmatism, 7  which is interpreted to have been plume related [ Pankhurst et al. , 2000; Storey , 1995], commenced during the Jurassic  at 180 Ma as South America, Africa and the Weddell Sea region of Antarctica started to separate and form the South Atlantic and Southern Ocean [ Ferris et al. , 2000; Pankhurst  et al. , 2000; Storey , 1995]. By 120 Ma (Early Cretaceous; Aptian), Gondwana was fragmented everywhere but the New Zealand sector, and the fragments were starting to disperse as seafloor spreading ridges were established [ Lawver et al. , 1987; Marks and Tikku , 2001; MÃ¼ller et al. , 2000; NÃ¼rnberg and MÃ¼ller , 1991].

The lithospheric and sublithospheric mantle of West Antarctica (including the Ross Sea and Marie Byrd Land) is characterized by a broad anomaly of 3of16 B05402  New Zealand region at 200, 500, Ritsema and van Heijst Gu et al. [2001]. The position of cross , 2000]. low seismic velocities at &lt;400 km depth (Figure 2). The   intermediate depth low velocity anomaly spans the transi-  tion zone and upper part of the lower mantle between 400 and 1100 km depths (Figure 2). Finally, a region of high S  wave velocities above the core mantle boundary (CMB) has Â­ a depth extent of approximately 2000 2900 km (Figure 2),  and is attributed to high density material that accumulated during Paleozoic and Mesozoic Gondwana subduction. [ ] The details of three anomalous structures differ 9 between tomographic models (Figure 2). The shallowest  low velocity anomaly appears to be connected to a much   larger shallow low seismic velocity anomaly that is spa- tially correlated with the location of Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic seafloor spreading and continental extension for all of the tomographic inversions (Figure 2).

250 spasojevic jgrb16251.pdf,RD,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Model Results 5.1. Size and Position of Buoyancy Anomalies [ ] We first attempted to reproduce all observations in a 19  time dependent model with a single upwelling positioned immediately above a downwelling. The downwelling is   designed to correlate with the high seismic velocity anom-  aly deep in the lower mantle (Figure 2). Although the high velocity region may be the result of slab accumulation, we simplify the downwelling by introducing a single body with c = 800 km. The upwelling anomaly, located immediately above the downwelling at 80 Ma, with its lower edge 100 km from the upper edge of the downwelling, is designed  to reproduce general features of the seismically low velocity region at the end of calculation (0 Ma). The short diameter of the upwelling is varied between 500 and 800 km. The values D of diameters a and b, and T are assumed to be the same a for both the upwelling and downwelling. We start all models at 80 Ma, roughly coincident with proposed initi-  ation of ANT Pacific spreading [ Stock and Molnar , 1987; Sutherland , 1999a]. [ ] The observed geoid and bathymetry anomaly con- 20 strain the size and position of the anomalies. If the initial size of the anomalies is too small or large, the predicted geophysical anomalies are spatially smaller or larger than 6of16 B05402  observed. The long wavelength extent and trend of the geoid and dynamic topography (Figure 3) are best re- produced with anomalous bodies that have longest diameter a approximately 4000 km, initially centered at 170Â°E and 75Â°S at 80 Ma. Since the observed anomalies are slightly  elongated in the east west direction (Figure 3), parallel to the Antarctica margin, we choose b = 3000 km. We tested a number of models with larger and smaller values of a and b, but they fail to reproduce the observed wavelengths. 5.2. Magnitude of Buoyancy Anomalies [ ] From the conservation of momentum and energy, 21 dynamic topography in uniform viscosity and layered vis- cosity domain can be described as: h Ã° t ÃžÂ¼ C Ã° t Ãž Ã<81> T Ã° 6 Ãž 1  UM h Ã° t ÃžÂ¼ C Ã° t Ãž Ã<81> T Ã° 7 Ãž 2  LM D where h is dynamic topography, T is temperature anom- aly, C and C are numerical functions obtained from the 1 2 solution of flow and is dependent on the viscosity and h h temperature structure, and and are viscosities of LM UM lower and upper mantle, respectively [ Gurnis et al. , 2000]. The nondimensional temperature anomaly is defined with respect to a temperature of 3000Â°C. [ ] Assuming the observed bathymetric anomaly 22 (Figures 3b and 3c) can be attributed to dynamic topogra- phy, we use it to constrain the amplitude of the temperature anomaly. When we systematically vary the initial tem- peratures (Figure 4), while holding the initial depths ( d = u h h 1300 km and d = 2000 km) and viscosity ratio ( : = d LM UM D 100:1) constant, small values of T = 0.05 predict dynamic a topography on order of only 100 m (Figure 4a), significantly Â­ D less than the observed 500 1000 m. For large values of T a (0.2 and 0.3), the predicted maximum dynamic topography is on the order of 5 km, much larger than observed (Figures 4d  and 4e). Observed present day dynamic topography is re- Â­ produced with nondimensional temperatures of 0.1 0.15 (Figures 4b and 4c), with a best prediction of the geoid for D T = 0.15 (Figure 4c), and estimated error of 0.05. a D  [ ] For large nondimensional temperatures of T 0.2, 23 a the upwelling rises quickly, underplates the lithosphere, and overpredicts dynamic topography (Figures 4d and 4e). D  Models with T 0.2 reproduce both regions of a  sublithospheric and transition zone upper mantle high tem-  peratures (Figures 4d and 4e), equivalent to the two low seismic velocity regions evident in tomography. However, we find that dynamic topography is significantly over- D  predicted for all models with T 0.2 and all models in a which the main mantle upwelling underplates the lithosphere. Only when the main large upwelling ends up within the   transition zone upper lower mantle depth range (Figures 4b D Â­ and 4c; T = 0.1 0.15), can we successfully match a residual bathymetry (Figure 3b), regardless of the initial depth or mantle viscosities.  [ ] There is a trade off between the magnitude of the 24 temperature anomaly and the mantle viscosities (equation 7). D We iteratively varied T and mantle viscosities, and found a D Â­ that T in range of 0.1 0.15 always best predicted dynamic a D topography. For all subsequent results, we fixed T to 0.15, a c(""Figure 4."", ""Constraining temperature anomaly based on predictions of dynamic topography (500 m"", ""contour interval), geoid (10 m contour interval), and upwelling geometry at 0 Ma for"", ""(b) 0.10, (c) 0.15, (d) 0.20, and (e) 0.30.

Discussion 6.1. Mantle Dynamics and Viscosity Structure  [ ] We can fit both the present day (geoid, dynamic 35  tomography, and seismic structure) and time dependent (tectonic subsidence of Campbell Plateau) observations in a single dynamic model with a relatively simple initial geometry and viscosity structure. We define thermal anomalies as triaxial ellipsoids that are designed to repro-  duce the large scale characteristics of mantle flow and evolution, rather than to match the exact shape and extent imaged in seismic tomography. In reality, these anomalies certainly have a more complex geometry, but since tomography models differ significantly in their detail of   midmantle and lower mantle seismic velocity structure [ Grand , 2002; Gu et al. , 2001; Masters et al. , 2000; Ritsema and van Heijst , 2000], we choose to use simplified forward models designed to match the general geometrical char- acteristics and depth ranges of the largest anomalies. When the resolution and coverage of tomography models in the  Antarctica New Zealand region are improved, it will be possible to better separate and define the position and shape of the velocity anomalies of interest (in particular the mid- mantle velocity low and lower mantle velocity high), and seismic properties could then be used as input to inverse models that have a more complex parameterization [e.g., Liu et al. , 2008]. We also simplify the definition of the boundary layers in a way that is appropriate for the tectonic setting. The top boundary layer is treated as a layer with a high viscosity, with the temperature being equal to the back- ground mantle temperature. This formulation is appropriate since the study region is dominated by divergent boundaries during the whole model history, and the buoyancy anoma- lies were dominated by advection below the lithosphere when the model results were compared with the observa- tions. A bottom thermal boundary layer is also neglected because the region since the Late Cretaceous was domi- nated by a large downwelling associated with subducted Gondwana slabs without any active plumes rising from the  core mantle boundary. [ ] On the basis of the spatial scale of the Ross sea geoid 36 and topography anomaly, we define the largest (one hot and one cold) buoyancy anomalies to have lateral and vertical Â­ dimensions of 4000 km and 600 800 km, respectively. On  the basis of our fit to the observed present day dynamic topography and geoid, we determine a maximum tempera- 12 of 16 B05402 ture anomaly of approximately 450Â°C, giving an average temperature anomaly within the rising upwelling of about 200Â°C. On the basis of direct conversion of seismic veloc- ities to thermal anomalies, maximum temperature anomalies have previously been estimated to be +600Â°C at 1400 km  depth beneath the Ross Sea, and 400Â°C at 2800 km depth [ Deschamps and Trampert , 2003]. The global average of temperature variability is estimated to be approximately 190Â°C at 1400 km depth [ Deschamps and Trampert , 2003], while temperature anomalies close to the CMB could reach as much as 900Â°C [ Deschamps and Trampert , 2003; Forte and Mitrovica , 2001]. Accounting for both a thermal and compositional origin for tomographic anomalies, tempera- ture variation is estimated to be between 200Â°C [ Karato and Karki , 2001] and 300Â°C [ Deschamps and Trampert , 2003] Â­ for upper parts of the lower mantle; and 300 400Â°C for midmantle [ Deschamps and Trampert , 2003]; and 500Â°C [ Deschamps and Trampert , 2003] to more than 1000Â°C [ Karato and Karki , 2001] for the lowermost mantle. Although the temperature anomaly we infer is in the range of values suggested by these studies, it should be noted that we assume that the entire upwelling/downwelling anomaly is thermal. It is possible that a part of the buoyancy we infer is compositional, which could result in lower estimates of temperature anomalies beneath the ANT margin. If the anomalies were entirely thermal in origin, the corresponding average density difference between the anomaly and the ambient mantle would be about 0.6%. In addition, we use a constant coefficient of thermal expansion (Table 1). If a  depth dependent coefficient was used, we would have ob- tained different estimates of thermal anomaly, but the esti- mated value of density anomaly would remain unchanged. [ ] By simultaneously introducing instantaneous and 37  time dependent observations, we are able to infer both rel- ative and absolute mantle viscosities for the assumed initial geometry. Seismic tomography provides information on the  present day distribution of mantle heterogeneity, and is the result of the history of mantle flow. The lower to upper mantle viscosity ratio that we find is best able to fit all  observations is about 100:1, with present day dynamic topography and geoid giving the strongest constraints.  Time dependent observations impose important constraints  on the absolute value of the viscosities, with a lower mantle 23 viscosity of 10 Pa s and an upper mantle viscosity of 21 10 Pa s giving the most acceptable fits. A stiffer mantle,  23 having lower mantle viscosity higher than 10 Pa s, results in underestimated dynamic topography, geoid and tectonic subsidence, with an overestimated final depth of buoyant  anomalies. A less viscous mantle, with lower mantle vis- 23 cosity being smaller than 10 Pa s, results in a relatively rapid rise of anomalies, overpredicting tectonic subsidence and dynamic topography, while having final depth of hot anomaly too shallow. The best initial depth of the large upwelling anomaly in our models is around 1300 km. When individual observational constraints are imposed separately,  we find a trade off between initial depth and viscosity, where deep anomaly/less viscous mantle can give an equally  well constrained prediction as shallow anomaly/more vis- cous mantle. However, when the observations are used jointly, a narrower range of possible mantle viscosities and anomaly depths are found. c(""["", ""38"", ""] Absolute viscosities can be independently obtained"", ""by inversion of postglacial rebound rates ["", ""Milne et al."", "", 2004]"", ""or joint inversion of convection and glacial isostatic"", ""adjustment ["", ""Mitrovica and Forte"", "", 2004].

""B05402"") B05402 SPASOJEVIC ET AL.: ANTARCTICA-NEW ZEALAND DYNAMIC MODELS zone, and (3) upper mantle plumes, but the upwellings we propose do not correspond to any of the previously identi- fied types. While specific phase transitions may lead to a layered viscosity and density structure and hence to certain modes of plume behavior, we suggest that the role of sub- duction in the genesis of instabilities that lead to upwelling may have been overlooked [ Sutherland et al. , 2010]. Slabs that pass through the transition zone may sequester H O 2 in superhydrous B [ Ohtani et al. , 2003] or D phases [ Hirschmann , 2006]. Ohtani et al. [2004] suggest that decomposition of superhydrous phases could occur at depths as large as 1250 km, resulting in hydration and/or melting of the mantle. Therefore, it is possible that the  seismic low velocity region imaged in the midmantle below  the Antarctic New Zealand region has been created by chemical and/or hydration reaction of mantle with subduct- ing slabs below 660 km depth. If such a process is contin- uously active during subduction, it is possible that buoyancy anomalies have been created continuously, extending from midmantle depths to the surface. Buoyant material may be released to become upwellings when changes in subduction rate or the termination of subduction occurs and the com- peting downward force is reduced [ Sutherland et al. , 2010]. The predicted correlation between reduction in subduction rate and subsequent mantle upwelling could be tested by analysis of the geologic record from ancient subduction systems for which it is possible to compute the past sub- duction rate. [ ] Tests of the plume generation hypothesis presented 45 above may rest with the details of the geochemistry of  mantle derived rocks. It is outside of our present scope to explore this subject in detail, but we do present a few rel-  evant observations from the NZ ANT region. Cretaceous igneous rocks from New Zealand have high U/Pb mantle  (HIMU) isotopic signatures, interpreted to be plume related, but Antarctic rocks do not [ Mukasa and Dalziel , 2000; Weaver et al. , 1994]. In contrast, Late Cenozoic mafic igneous rocks are widespread in the Ross Sea and Marie Byrd Land and do have geochemistry that falls on a HIMU trend [ Behrendt et al. , 1991; Finn et al. , 2005; Rocchi et al. , 2002]. Superficially, this seems in excellent agreement with the general characteristics of our models. However, to test the plume generation model that we propose requires a specific geochemical prediction from the model, and an understanding of the inherited geochemistry of the mantle, and of the lithospheric processes and chemical history near the sample site. A HIMU descriptor may not be optimal or appropriate. We conclude that initial interpretations support our models, but we leave the development of this discussion to more detailed future study."
250 spasojevic jgrb16251.pdf,C,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Conclusions  [ ] Anomalous geophysical observations at NZ ANT 46 margin can be reproduced with a dynamic model in which two hot anomalies evolved above a cold downwelling related to Gondwana subduction. The main larger hot mantle anomaly, centered above the Ross sea region, ori- Â­ ginates from a midmantle depth range of 1000 1600 km at 80 Ma, and has an average temperature approximately 200Â°C higher than the background mantle. If the anomalies were thermal in origin, the corresponding average density 14 of 16 B05402 variation between the anomaly and background mantle would be about 0.6%. This buoyant anomaly reached the   upper mantle at 20 Ma, and it evolved to a present day Â­ depth range of 400 1000 km, resulting in up to 1 km of dynamic topography that is now observed along the ANT margin.  [ ] Campbell Plateau subsidence and present day residual 47  bathymetry of the Antarctica Pacific ridge is related to evolution of an additional hot anomaly, located at 80 Ma in the upper mantle, and which has now underplated the  lithosphere to form a shallow seismic low velocity anomaly.  The mantle upwelling creates a long lived dynamic topog- raphy high, and the anomalous Campbell Plateau subsidence was a result of northward drift away from this dynamic topography high.  [ ] By using present day (geoid, dynamic topography 48  and seismic tomography) and time dependent (tectonic subsidence) observations, we are able to infer both relative and absolute mantle viscosities. The relative viscosity ratio is h h rather high, with : = 100:1, and the steep gradient of LM UM  the viscosities could be created by long lived Gondwanaland  subduction that resulted in an extensive pile up of denser and more viscous material in the lower mantle that is overlain by a region of hydration. The absolute viscosities of the  21 upper and lower mantle in the NZ ANT region are 10 23 and 10 , respectively. [ ] The Ross sea geoid low could be reproduced only 49  when the large scale main upwelling anomaly is positioned across the transition zone and top of the lower mantle. This globally significant geoid low is reproduced in our model through a combination of the intermediate wavelength of upwelling and the high gradient of mantle viscosity. [ ] Acknowledgments.

S 1 1 Ond ej rÃ¡mek and Shijie Zhong Received 14 March 2010; revised 2 June 2010; accepted 15 June 2010; published 24 September 2010. A dynamic link between the early evolution of Tharsis and the crustal dichotomy on [ ] 1 Mars was recently proposed by Zhong (2009). We address in detail the fundamental  aspects of the proposed model using 3 D spherical shell modeling of convection. We investigate the conditions under which a spherical harmonic degree 1 flow is produced in the mantle of Mars in layered viscosity models with different depths of viscosity layering and different viscosity ratios between the bottom and top layers. We find that a thinner weak layer requires a larger viscosity decrease in order to produce degree planform, in qualitative accordance with existing analytical studies. A lithospheric keel of hemispheric extent, which may represent melt residue after dichotomy formation process, is then introduced in the models. As a consequence, thermal upwellings are first formed and oriented below the center of the melt residue cap. For keels of maximum ^  thickness 100 km, a rotation of the entire single plate lithosphere relative to the underlying mantle follows until the plume is stabilized near the edge of the keel, which can be identified as the dichotomy boundary. This model may explain the early migration of the Tharsis volcanic center from southern latitudes to the vicinity of the dichotomy ^ boundary. For keels 200 km thick, the modeled time scales agree with observationally inferred migration rate. If the Tharsis migration is caused by the rotation of the lithosphere, the requirement on the amount and location of upper mantle melting would argue for an endogenic origin of the dichotomy.

252 sramek jgre2800.pdf,I,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Introduction [ ] Taking even a brief look at the topographic map of 2  Mars, one notices two major, global scale physiographic features. One is the difference in mean elevation between the northern and the southern hemispheres, referred to as the hemispheric dichotomy. The other, the Tharsis Rise, is a large elevated region near the equator in the western hemisphere that comprises several large volcanoes. The origin of the dichotomy as well as the nature of the Tharsis volcanic province are still being debated. [ ] Using Mariner 9 and earlier data, Hartmann [1973] 3 discussed the bimodal character of the hypsometric curve (i.e., histogram of surface elevation) on Mars. He suggested two distinct petrological blocks for the lowlands and high- ' lands crust, akin to the Earth s continental rafts floating in a denser oceanic material. Schubert and Lingenfelter [1973] proposed that a difference in crustal thickness is the most Â­ likely candidate to explain the center of mass center of 1 Department of Physics, University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder, Colorado, USA.

This picture was refined as the data obtained Â­ during the 1996 2006 Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) mis- sion became available. Based on analysis of the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data [ Zuber et al. , 1992; Smith et al. , 1998, 1999a] and the MGS gravity field mea- surements [ Tyler et al. , 1992; Smith et al. , 1999b], Zuber  et al. [2000] showed that the north south hemispheric asymmetry in topography is well explained as a manifesta- tion of isostatically compensated crust with lateral thick- ness variations. The two maxima on the crustal thickness  distribution curve are separated by 26 km, which results  in 5.5 km difference in elevation [ Neumann et al. , 2004; Watters et al. , 2007], as measured by MOLA [ Smith et al. , 2001]. The abrupt elevation difference across the dichot- omy boundary is between 2 and 4 km [ Frey et al. , 1998],   and is superimposed on a more gentle north to south pole slope. An expression of the hemispheric dichotomy is found also in the magnetic field [ Purucker et al. , 2000], surface age pattern and the surface geology in general [ Tanaka , 1986; Tanaka et al. , 1992]. [ ] Watters et al. [2007] provided a detailed summary on 4 the crustal ages and the dichotomy formation time. The cratered southern highlands of Noachian age are the oldest exposed rocks.

[ ] Both the hemispheric dichotomy and Tharsis are 14 primarily spherical harmonic degree 1 structures. The early migration of the Tharsis volcanic center and the relative locations of Tharsis and the dichotomy boundary motivated Zhong [2009] to suggest a dynamical link between these two structures. In his model, a thicker lithosphere in the current southern hemisphere is assumed to have resulted from some process accompanied by partial melting, which led to the formation of the thick crust. This could be, for example, partial melting above a single dominant upwelling in the  mantle [ Roberts and Zhong , 2006] or a large scale overturn of post magma ocean cumulates accompanied by decom-  pression melting [ Elkins Tanton et al. , 2005]. The thick lithospheric keel in one hemisphere thus represents a residue after melting and is expected to have an increased viscosity due to devolatilization [e.g., Pollack , 1986]. With a realistic temperature and depth dependence of viscosity and a step viscosity increase in midmantle, which produces convective planform with a single upwelling [ Roberts and Zhong , 2006], Zhong [2009] reports (1) formation of the upwell- ing, initially centered below the thick lithospheric keel; (2) subsequent differential movement between the entire lithospheric shell and the upwelling, during which the plume moves toward the edge of the lithospheric keel; (3) and final stabilization of the plume near the keel boundary (i.e., the dichotomy boundary). This model therefore dynamically relates the formation of Tharsis to the preexisting crustal dichotomy. It may explain the early migration of Tharsis  with respect to the dichotomy, and its subsequent long term stabilization at the current location near the dichotomy boundary. [ ] The goal of this study is to systematically address the 15 ' aspects of Zhong s [2009] model. In the first part we investigate the convective planform of models with uniform lithospheric thickness. We focus on the effect of varying the thickness of the weak layer in models with viscosity layer-  ing, and identify the conditions under which degree 1 convection forms. This supplements previous work by Roberts and Zhong [2006], who kept the weak layer thickness unchanged. Second, we extend the models by including a lithosphere of variable thickness and study the relative rotation of the lithosphere and the deeper mantle. In section 2 we describe the model setup. The results for models with uniform lithospheric thickness and with lateral variation in lithospheric thickness are presented in sections 3 and 4, respectively. Discussion follows in section 5, where we first address the more general aspects inherent in our models, such as the preferred wavelength of convection, modulation of convective planform by partial surface insu- lation, and the interaction of mantle flow and lithospheric thickness variations, before discussing specific questions related to Martian evolution. In section 6 we summarize the main findings."

252 sramek jgre2800.pdf,RD,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Models With Uniform Lithospheric Thickness [ ] The suite of models in this section is designed to 21 investigate how the convective planform of layered viscos- ity models changes with the depth of layering and the magnitude of viscosity contrast, and in particular what are the conditions for spherical harmonic degree 1 convection, which is needed in the rotation of the lithosphere model [ Zhong , 2009]. Our knowledge of the viscosity structure of Martian interior is quite limited. Viscosity layering of the Martian mantle has been suggested, but the layering depth as well as the viscosity contrast are not well constrained. It is therefore useful to perform a study of the preferred con- vection wavelength dependence on these two parameters. Of E09010 course, this issue is also of general fluid dynamics interest. The cases presented here extend the previous analysis of Roberts and Zhong [2006], where the depth of viscosity layering was kept constant. The input parameters and some output values of the computed cases are shown in Table 2. [ ] We start with a case TC1, which is identical to 22 ` ' ` ' Model 1 of Zhong [2009] and Case V3 of Roberts and  Zhong [2006]. It includes a 25 fold viscosity increase at ` ' 1020 km depth. Run a of case TC1 (hereafter denoted TC1_a) started from initial radial temperature profile with somewhat higher temperatures compared to the final state of this case, and a spherical harmonic degree 11 horizontal h i perturbation. The average nondimensional temperature T decreased from 0.739 to 0.712 at the end of the calculation. Degree 1 dominates the spherical harmonic spectrum, cal-  culated 100 km above run core mantle boundary, starting at time 630 Myr and remains so for the rest of calculation ` ' (Figure 2a). Run b of case TC1 (denoted TC1_b) started from an initial radial temperature profile close to the final profile for this case, and a random perturbation. The average h i temperature T slightly decreases from 0.717 to 0.715. Degree 1 becomes the strongest at 470 Myr (Figure 2b). The final states from runs TC1_a and TC1_b are identical, thus confirming that the initial condition has no effect on the final convective planform. Our results are also in agreement ` ' with Case V3 of Roberts and Zhong [2006]. Horizontally h i averaged temperature T away from the boundary layers h   varies between 0.7 in the topmost mantle and 0.8 in the deep mantle (Figure 3a). The temperature drop across the upper thermal boundary layer is larger than for the bottom boundary layer due to the large contribution of internal  heating to the total heating ( 82%). The total viscosity increase across the mantle, including the step increase at  1020 km depth, is by a factor of 130 (Figure 3b). The final Â­ thermal structure, shown in Figures 4a 4b, is a single localized upwelling. The flow field evolves to the final state  through a stage with a circumferential sheet like upwelling (Figure 4c). The thermal anomalies are strongest in the Â­ boundary layers, within 100 150 km of the top and bottom boundaries. Spherical harmonic degree 1 is the strongest at  all depths in the final state; the near surface temperature field has a strong degree 2 component. [ ] Case TC2 is identical to TC1 except for a shallower 23 viscosity layering, which occurs at depth 770 km instead of c(""1020 km. It is started from the same initial condition as case"", ""TC1_b. With a viscosity decrease in the upper layer by a"", ""factor 25, the thermal structure develops into a state with an"", ""upwelling plume, and an elongated sheet"", """", ""like upwelling in"", ""the opposite hemisphere (Figure 4d).

The resulting average mantle temperature"", """", ""is lower than in TC3 by"", ""0.07 (130 K). Lower mantle vis-"", ""7of20"") E09010  cosity is increased by a factor of 3.1 with respect to TC3,  while the upper layer viscosity is lower by a factor 1.4, yielding an overall viscosity increase by 590 in the mantle. The final thermal structure has a localized plume and an  antipodal ridge like upwelling, and degree 2 is the strongest at all depths (Figures 4h and 2g). [ ] In order to observe convection at dominant spherical 28 harmonic degree 1, the imposed viscosity contrast has to be increased to 200, which was done in case TC33. Final  temperature in the mantle is lower by 0.11 (220 K) com- pared to case TC3, lower layer viscosity is increased by a  factor of 6, and upper layer viscosity decreased by a factor    of 1.4; across the mantle viscosity increase is by a factor of 1200. Degree 1 becomes the strongest at all depths at 630 My (Figure 2h) and the thermal structure is dominated  by a single upwelling with 3 ridge like flanks (Figure 4i). [ ] As the imposed viscosity jump is increased, within 29 each series of cases with constant depth of layering d (i.e., l -- -- series TC2 TC21 and TC3 TC33) the temperature of the mantle decreases. Accordingly, the viscosity in the lower mantle increases. However, the upper layer becomes pro- gressively weaker. This is because the step decrease in vis- cosity more than compensates for the lower temperature (Figure 3b). The weaker upper layer leads to higher surface heat flux, therefore faster cooling, which explains the lower interior temperature. The regime diagram in Figure 5 sum- marizes the computed cases as a function of the nondimen- R sional layering depth d / R and the viscosity contrast . h l 0 Lithospheric Thickness [ ] In this section we include a lithospheric keel that 30 represents the stiff residue left after partial melting which may be responsible for the formation of thickened crust in one hemisphere of Mars (i.e., the hemispheric dichotomy). This keel introduces strong lateral variations in viscosity near the surface.

[ ] Case TC32B, which was started from time step 40 20,000 of case TC32, also develops a strong degree 1 (Figure 7e), unlike in the case with uniform lithosphere  (Figure 4h for TC32), at t 40 Myr, in the form of a plume cluster below the thick lithosphere. The lithosphere then rotates with respect to the plume cluster at average rate of  1.5Â°/Myr (Figure 8b). Similar stretching and cluster breakup occurs as in TC31B. [ ] The initial state of case TC33B is an upwelling 41 structure with dominant degree 1 (step 10,0000 of TC33). We placed the keel in a position antipodal to the upwelling center (Figure 10j). The flow field initially breaks up into a   shorter wavelength pattern, but at t 150 Myr a broad cluster of plumes forms below the keel and degree 1 dom- inates the flow (Figures 7f and 10k). The presence of the keel therefore controls the flow geometry to the extent that it can flip a preexisting degree 1 structure by 180Â°. After the upwelling forms below the keel, a fast rotation of the litho-  sphere at a rate of 1.5Â°/Myr follows (Figure 8b). In this case the plume structure does not stabilize near the keel boundary but the rotation continues until the stretched upwelling is approximately antipodal to the keel (Figure 10l). At that point the plume breaks into two separate upwellings. [ ] To summarize this section, we have found that the 42 rotation of the lithosphere is a robust feature, present in all our models except those with a very small variations in lithospheric thickness. In order to excite the rotation of the lithospheric shell, the thickness variations have to be of the order of at least 100 km. A hemispheric variation in litho- spheric thickness as little as tens of km is sufficient to focus  the degree 1 thermal upwelling below the center of the hemisphere with thicker lithosphere. The presence of the lithospheric keel can also increase the wavelength of con- vection toward spherical harmonic degree 1, or reorient a  preexisting degree 1 structure. We will further discuss the mechanism of the rotation and the rotation rates in section 5.2. In addition to cases with imposed lithospheric keel in one hemisphere, we have also investigated cases with  hemispheric variation in near surface thermal conductivity (i.e., imposing an insulating cap). These will also be pre- sented in section 5.2. Discussion [ ] The models presented in this study contain several 43 aspects relevant to convection and mantle dynamics in general. We will address these first, before discussing more specific questions related to evolution of Mars. 5.1. What Determines Convective Wavelength? [ ] The fundamental question of what controls the pre- 44 ferred convective wavelength has been addressed by many authors, particularly in the view of large aspect ratio con- vection cells associated with plate tectonics on the Earth. Early studies investigated the effect of boundary conditions [ Chapman et al. , 1980; Hewitt et al. , 1980] as well as the  depth dependent viscosity structure [ Jaupart and Parsons ,  1985]. First 3 D spherical shell convection models sug- gested a shift of spherical harmonic spectrum power to lower degrees by endothermic phase transition [ Tackley et al. , c(""1993] or by viscosity increase from upper to lower mantle"", ""["", ""Bunge et al."", "", 1996], even though the preferred wavelength"", ""they obtained was mostly at degree 6 or shorter, and is"", ""significantly smaller than the degree"", """", ""2 planform indicated"", ""by global seismic tomography [e.g.,"", ""Ritsema et al."", "", 1999], or"", ""even degree"", """", ""1 flow suggested to have occurred over periods"", ""in Earth"", ""'"", ""s history ["", ""Zhong et al."", "", 2007].

The interaction  between long wavelength mantle convection and litho- spheric thickness variations may excite lithospheric rotation  with respect to the mantle, and cause plume related volca- nism to migrate on the planetary surfaces. In this study we  have considered a predominantly degree 1 lithospheric thickness variation, with axially symmetrical keels of angular radius 90 degrees. This mantle flow lithosphere interaction mechanism may, however, operate at shorter dominant wavelengths too. To test this idea, we ran one model with two antipodal keels of angular radius 60Â° and maximum thickness 260 km but otherwise identical to case TC1A. This keel geometry imposes a corresponding increase in the dominant spherical harmonic of the flow from 1 (of  the single keel case TC1A) to 2, with one upwelling below each keel. The rotation of the lithosphere is also excited in  the two keel case. In general, the behavior may depend on the difference between the respective dominant wavelengths of the lithospheric thickness variations and of the convec- tive structure. Apart from Mars, the lithospheric rotation may be potentially important for evolution of other terres- trial planetary bodies such as the Moon or the satellites of gas giants."
252 sramek jgre2800.pdf,C,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Conclusions [ ] In the present study, we used numerical modeling of 67  convection in 3 D spherical shell to investigate in detail ` ' aspects of the rotation of the lithosphere model for Mars [ Zhong , 2009]. Our main findings can be summarized as follows. [ ] We investigated the conditions under which a 68 spherical harmonic degree 1 flow is produced in the mantle of Mars in layered viscosity models with weak upper mantle. Moderate viscosity increase by a factor of 25 in the  midmantle leads to degree 1 convection. With decreasing thickness of the weak layer, a progressively larger viscosity  contrast is necessary for degree 1 flow. The trade off between the depth of layering d and the lower to upper layer l R  viscosity ratio necessary to produce degree 1 convection h - a R / can be described by a power law d with the h l a exponent around 4. [ ] Introducing a hemispheric variation in lithospheric 69 thickness, a lithospheric keel of hemispheric extent that represents melt residue after dichotomy formation process, results in formation and preferential orientation of upwel- lings in the hemisphere with thicker lithosphere. In cases where shorter wavelength flow (degree 2 or 3) arises with uniform lithospheric thickness, the presence of the litho-  spheric keel can organize the flow into a degree 1 pattern.  [ ] If the maximum keel thickness is at least 100 km in 70  cases with 25 fold viscosity increase at 1000 km depth, a rotation of the entire lithospheric shell relative to the underlying mantle is excited, during which the angular distance between the lithospheric keel center and the posi- tion of upwelling increases from near 0 to near 90Â°. Similar behavior is observed for cases with a thinner weak layer. The separation rate seems to be controlled mostly by the amplitude of the lithospheric thickness variation and the magnitude of viscosity decrease in the weak layer, and is 18 of 20 E09010 relatively independent of the exact keel shape and the thickness of the weak channel. A keel of 260 km maximum  Â­ thickness results in plume keel separation rate of 0.7 1.5 degrees per Myr, depending on the viscosity structure. [ ] The relative motion between the lithosphere and the 71 upwelling may explain the observed early migration of Tharsis volcanic center over the first few hundred Myr after  its formation. Maximum keel thickness of at least 200 km is required to explain the inferred Tharsis migration time scales. [ ] If the early migration of Tharsis was caused by this 72 mechanism, the requirement on lithosphere thickness vari- ation puts constrains on the dichotomy formation process. A few hundred km thick melt residue below the southern highlands can be produced by partial melting of upwelling mantle material, inherent in models of endogenic origin. An impact in the northern hemisphere is unlikely to produce the necessary lithospheric thickness variations in the southern hemisphere below the thickened crust.

We introduce a novel scheme, DGCrack, to simulate dynamic rupture of earthquakes [ ] 1 in three dimensions based on an hp-adaptive discontinuous Galerkin method. We solve the velocity-stress weak formulation of elastodynamic equations on an unstructured tetrahedral mesh with arbitrary mesh refinements (h-adaptivity) and local approximation orders (p-adaptivity). Our scheme considers second-order fault elements (P2) where dynamic-rupture boundary conditions are enforced through To model the Coulomb slip-dependent friction law, we introduce a predictor-corrector scheme for estimating shear fault tractions, in addition to a special treatment of the normal tractions that guarantees the continuity of fault normal velocities. We verify the DGCrack by comparison with several methods for two spontaneous rupture tests and find excellent agreement (i.e., rupture times RMS errors smaller than 1.0%) provided that one or more fault elements resolve the fault cohesive zone. For a quantitative comparison, we introduce a methodology based on cross-correlation measurements that provide a simple way to quantify the similarity between solutions. Our verification tests include a 60 normal fault reaching the free surface. The DGCrack method reveals convergence rates close to those of well-established methods and a numerical efficiency significantly higher than that of similar discontinuous Galerkin approaches. We apply the method to the 1992 Landers-earthquake fault system in a layered medium, considering heterogeneous initial stress conditions and mesh adaptivities. Our results show that previously proposed dynamic models for the Landers earthquake require a reevaluation in terms of the initial stress conditions that take account of the intricate fault geometry.

One set of methods is based on well established boundary integral equa- tions (BIE), [e.g., Das and Aki , 1977; Andrews ,1985; Cochard and Madariaga , 1994; Kame and Yamashita , 1999; Aochi et al. ,2000; Lapusta et al. , 2000; Hok and Fukuyama , 2011]. However, since these methods discretize only boundaries and require semi-analytical approximations of Green functions, they have difficulties integrating heterogeneities of the bulk properties into which the fault is embedded. The other set consists of domain methods based on weak formulations of the 1of 21 c(""TAGO ET AL.: DG-FEM FOR RUPTURE DYNAMICS"", ""B09312"", ""elastodynamic equations, and can be separated into two sub-"", ""groups depending on how the lattice boundaries are treated."", ""On one hand the continuous finite element methods (FEM),"", ""whose formulations require continuity between the mesh"", ""elements except where special treatments of boundary con-"", ""ditions are imposed [e.g.,"", ""Oglesby and Day"", "", 2001;"", ""Ampuero"", "","", ""2002;"", ""Festa and Vilotte"", "", 2006;"", ""Ma and Archuleta"", "", 2006;"",

Furthermore, intrinsic attenuation has been recently introduced into GeoDG3D via the rock quality Q [ Tago et al. , 2010], but will not be discussed in the present work. To maximize both the efficiency and the accuracy of the scheme depending on the model properties and geometry, the method handles unstructured mesh refinements (i.e., h- adaptivity) and locally adapts the order of the nodal inter- polations (i.e., within every grid element; p-adaptivity) [ Etienne et al. , 2010]. [ ] We first introduce the mathematical and computational 6 concepts for the 3D dynamic rupture problem, and then assess both its accuracy and convergence rate by comparing calcu- lated solutions with those yielded by finite difference (DFM), finite element (FEM), spectral boundary integral (MDSBI) and spectral element (SPECFEM3D) methods for two spon- taneous rupture benchmark tests [ Harris et al. , 2009]. Since one of our major goals in the near future is the investigation of dynamic rupture propagation along realistic (nonplanar) fault geometries, we take special care to verify the accuracy of the normal stress field across the fault during rupture propagation, as the fault normal tractions strongly determine the radiated energy throughout the Coulomb failure criterion. We finally illustrate the capabilities of the DGCrack method through a spontaneous rupture simulation along the 1992 Landers earthquake fault system, which is a geometrically intricate and physically interesting study case."

The accuracy for P2 elements with unstructured tetrahedral meshes is achieved with 3 tetrahedra per minimum wave- length, which is comparable with the 5 grid points required by the fourth-order staggered-grid finite difference method [ Levander , 1988], while the stability is determined with an heuristic criterion proposed by KÃ¤ser and Dumbser [2008] expressed as  1 2 r i D &lt; ; t min * Ã¾ 2 k 1 v i i p i where r is the radius of the sphere inscribed in the element i indexed by i , v is the P-wave velocity in the element and k is p i i the polynomial degree used in the element. [ ] The distribution of interpolation orders in the compu- 11 tational domain is such that P0 elements describe the CPML slab while elements with both P1 and P2 approximations dis- cretize the physical domain depending on their sizes. This enhances the accuracy of the scheme and minimizes the com- putational load. Current computational developments will allow us in the near future to consider higher interpolation orders away from the rupture zone for large-distance wave propagation."
256 tago jgrb17293.pdf,RD,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Dynamic Rupture Model [ ] Earthquakes are highly nonlinear phenomena produced 12 by sliding instabilities along geological faults. The stability of the rupture system depends on several physical factors, like the initial state of stresses in the earth, the material properties and rheology, the sliding rate, the fault geometry, and the consti- tutive relationship governing the mechanics of the rupture surface. During rupture propagation, fault tractions evolve dynamically depending on all these factors, and the accuracy of an earthquake model strongly depends on the correctness of boundary conditions applied to these tractions in accordance with the fault constitutive relationship (i.e., friction law), which in turn depends on the accurate energy transportation through elastic waves in the medium. Insuring the accuracy of both boundary conditions (local feature) and wave propagation (global feature) has long been a difficult task for many seis- mologists. In the next sections, we shall introduce both the fault boundary conditions and the friction law used in our dynamic source model and then its formulation into the DG scheme. In spite of the attention they deserve, we will not discuss the features of wave propagation in this study since they have been previously analyzed by Etienne et al. [2010] and Tago et al. [2010]. 3.1. Boundary Conditions and Friction Law G [ ] The fault, , is a piecewise discretized surface with a 13 ~ directed normal vector n , such that each side of each surface G element is clearly identified. Slip and stresses over are related through a friction law in such a way that the fault tangential tractions evolve according to that law, which in turn depends, for instance, on some fault kinematic param- eter (i.e., slip and slip rate) and wave propagation in the surroundings of the rupture tip. On the other hand, the strain field is accommodated, in the elastic medium, through dis- G placement (i.e., velocity) discontinuities across .

[ ] Definitions given for the normal (26) and tangen- 40 tial (24) traction components finally allow us to update the velocity field in every fault node via equation (20). 3.2.2. Fluxes Across the Fault for the Stress Scheme (17) [ ] For the stress scheme and within the i -tetrahedron, the 41 Ã¾ n 1 ~ flux across the fault, g , is computed using only the 2 i velocity field in that tetrahedron, through the equation (20), so that the flux is given by Ã¾ Ã¾ n 1 n 1 ~ Â¼P T ~ : Ã° Ãž g v 27 2 2 i i ik [ ] The simplicity of this flux stems from the computa- 42 tion of a unique traction vector on the fault that guarantees either the continuity or discontinuity of the velocity field depending on whether the fault has broken or not. This fault- flux approximation is equivalent to the one proposed by Benjemaa et al. [2009] for P0 elements, where the flux estimation is based on an energy balance consideration across the fault, but the simpler form of definition (27) is due to the continuity of the fault normal velocity implicit in the ~ n computation of T through (26). ik N and Efficiency [ ] Verification of dynamic rupture models is a particu- 43 larly difficult task. Since no analytical solution exists for the spontaneous rupture problem (i.e., closed form equations for the resulting motions), the only possible way to be confident of a given approach is the comparison of results for a well- posed rupture problem between various numerical techni- ques based on different approximations. This kind of exercise has been systematically performed in recent years by an international group of modelers [ Harris et al. , 2009]. In this section we present results for two benchmark tests proposed by this group, TPV3 and TPV10 (see: http://scecdata.usc.edu/ cvws/index.html), and compare them with those obtained with finite difference, finite element, spectral element, dis- continuous Galerkin and spectral boundary integral methods. Based on these comparisons, we assess the numerical con- vergence rate of our method, its efficiency and determine numerical criteria to guarantee its accuracy. 4.1. The Problem Version 3 (TPV3) [ ] Consider the spontaneous rupture of a vertical right- 44 lateral strike-slip fault embedded in a homogeneous full-space with P- and S-waves speeds of 6000 m/s and 3434 km/s, 3 respectively, and density of 2670 kg/m . The fault is rectan- gular and measures 30 km in length by 15 km in width (Figure 2). Rupture nucleation happens in a 3 km by 3 km square region, centered both along-strike and along-dip, c(""because the initial shear stress there is higher than the fault"", ""strength. The friction law is linear slip-weakening with zero"", ""cohesion (Equations (12) and (13)), and both static and"", ""dynamic friction coefficients are constant over the fault. The"", ""initial fault normal traction is also constant, as are the static"", ""and dynamic fault strengths. Values for all source parameters,"", ""i.e., initial stress conditions and friction parameters, are"", ""shown in Table 1. Results for this problem are compared with"", 
""those obtained by the DFM finite difference scheme ["", ""Day"", ""et al."", "", 2005], the ADER-DG discontinuous Galerkin scheme"", ""["", ""Pelties et al."", "", 2012] and the spectral boundary integral"", ""equation method by"", ""Geubelle and Rice"", ""[1995] with the"", ""implementation of E.M.

Fault System [ ] The 28 June 1992 Landers earthquake (Mw 7.3) in 56 southern California produced one of the most valuable data sets ever recorded. The amount and diversity of geo- physical observations allowed constraining the earthquake rupture history, revealing a large complexity of the slip pat- tern in a wide frequency range (&lt;0.5 Hz) [e.g., Campillo and Archuleta , 1993; Wald and Heaton , 1994; Olsen et al. , 1997; HernÃ¡ndez et al. , 1999]. The large rupture size (80 km long, 16 km wide), the long rupture duration (&gt;20 s) and the intricate fault-system geometry bring an exceptional oppor- tunity to test our discontinuous Galerkin source model. However, to fully understand the detailed rupture process of the Landers earthquake deserves an extensive analysis that goes beyond the purpose of this work. For this reason we shall mainly use this study case for illustrating the capabili- ties of the DGCrack approach in realistic conditions, and to elucidate some essential aspects of such an event related to the initial stress conditions along the fault. [ ] The Landers earthquake broke four main right-lateral 57 faults, namely the Johnson Valley, Homestead Valley and Emerson and Camp Rock faults, which are connected through jogs and step-overs (Figure 12b) forming a complex nonplanar fault system (Figure 10 and red segment in Figure 12b). The detailed fault geometry was taken from the Community Fault Model for Southern California [ Plesch et al. , 2007], which essentially consists of several strike-slip vertical segments, as shown in Figure 12b with grey dots. To discretize the model we considered a 1D layered medium [ Wald and Heaton , 1994] (see L1, L2 and L3 layer bound- aries on Figure 10) and took advantage of the hp-adaptivity. c(""This means that we refined the mesh around the rupture"", ""surface and simultaneously adapted the bulk elements sizes"", ""to resolve 0.5 Hz waves according to each layer properties, so"", ""that the wave-propagation accuracy criterion determined by"", ""Etienne et al."", ""[2010] is largely satisfied (i.e., five elements"", ""per minimum wavelength).

256 tago jgrb17293.pdf,C,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Conclusions [ ] In this work we have introduced a novel discontinuous 62 Galerkin method, the DGCrack, to simulate the dynamic rupture propagation of earthquakes in 3D along faults with intricate geometries (i.e., non-planar). The method is hp- 17 of 21 B09312 Wald and Heaton [1994]. adaptive, which means that the elements of the unstructured tetrahedral mesh discretizing the simulation domain may adapt both their sizes (h-adaptivity) and approximation orders (p-adaptivity) depending on the problem geometry and the medium properties (i.e., P0, P1 or P2 elements in the wave propagation domain, and P2 elements over the fault). To guarantee a fast convergence rate, our scheme imposes the dynamic-rupture boundary conditions through ad hoc fluxes across the fault that verify both the jump conditions intro- duced by Day et al. [2005] and an additional condition c(""TAGO ET AL.: DG-FEM FOR RUPTURE DYNAMICS"", ""B09312"", ""forcing the continuity of the fault-normal velocity field.

Numerical oscillations in the DGCrack solution are mainly present after 10 s of the earthquake nucleation, which is probably due either to long-range numerical dispersion associated with the centered fluxes across the fault or reflections associated with the unstructured mesh coarsening around the fault. However, since these oscillations remain reasonable small and we expect them to be even smaller for physically attenuating media [ Tago et al. , 2010] or different friction laws (e.g., rate- and state-dependent), we have decided not to integrate an artificial viscosity into the scheme. [ ] We finally applied the DGCrack method to study 66 some aspects of the 1992 Landers earthquake considering a realistic fault-system geometry. Our simulation deploy a 1D layered medium and took advantage of the hp-adaptivity by refining the unstructured mesh around the rupture surface and simultaneously adapting the elements sizes to resolve 0.5 Hz waves everywhere in the simulation domain. 48.6% of the 4.48 millions tetrahedra in the mesh are P1 elements and belong to the CPML slab, while the rest (51.4%) are P2 elements and discretize the entire physical domain. Our source model is based on a slightly modified version of the heterogeneous initial shear stress determined by Peyrat et al. [2001] on a planar fault from the final slip found by Wald and Heaton [1994]. Since both we had to reduce fracture energy by a factor of two with respect to the earthquake model proposed by Peyrat et al. [2001] to allow rupture propagation along the entire non-planar fault system, and obtained a significant seismic moment underestimation, we conclude that generating realistic pre-stress conditions for the Landers earthquake from its final slip distribution requires considering the fault-system geometry. [ ] Recent large subduction earthquakes have raised 67 fundamental questions concerning the stability and seg- mentation of the subduction zones. To study this seismo- genic regions accounting for more realistic physical behaviors, introducing into DGCrack both flexible friction laws (e.g., rate- and state-dependent) and the presence of fluids in the fault zone (i.e., thermal pressurization) would be essential in the near future."
256 tago jgrb17293.pdf,APX,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Propagation [ ] To solve the hyperbolic system (1), which models 68 the wave propagation in an elastic medium, we follow the DG-FEM method proposed by Etienne et al. [2010]. The method requires a discretization of the entire domain into sub-domains called elements. The DG-FEM is a mixture of two well-known methods: the Finite Element method (FEM), because it uses a space of basis functions and a space of test functions in each element [ Zienkiewicz et al. , 2005], and the Finite Volume method (FVM), since the elements are decoupled from each other but integrated through the evaluation of fluxes across the elements faces [ LeVeque , 2002]. The result of this combination is a method that ensures the geometric flexibility that supports local res- olution adaptivity and that can deal with wave-dominated problems.

For more details see Etienne et al. [2010].

Besides, the implementation of the DGCrack method into the GeoDG3D code (developed by Etienne et al. [2010]) was straightforward since we only need to recognize the fault surface in the domain and substitute the centered scheme fluxes with the ad hoc expressions derived in sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 over the fault, while leaving intact the rest of the code.

Â­  A strong 50 35 Ma decrease in India Asia convergence is generally ascribed to [ ] 1  continent continent collision. However, a convergence rate increase of similar magnitude  Â­ occurred between 65 50 Ma. An earlier increase occurred at accelerated convergence followed upon arrival of a mantle plume below and emplacement of a large igneous province (LIP) on the Indian plate. We here first confirm these  convergence rate trends, reassessing the Indo Atlantic plate circuits. Then, using two different numerical models, we assess whether plume head arrival and its lateral asthenospheric flow may explain the plate velocity increases and whether decreased plume  flux and increasing continent plume distance may explain deceleration, even without continental collision. The results show that plume head arrival can indeed lead to absolute Indian plate motion accelerations on the order of several cm/yr, followed by decelerations on timescales similar to the reconstructed fluctuations. The 90 Ma increase could potentially be explained as response to the Morondova mantle plume alone. The 65 convergence rate increase, however, is larger than can be explained by plume head spreading alone. We concur with previous hypotheses that plume  the Indian continental lithosphere asthenosphere coupling and an increased slab pull and ridge push efficiency are the most likely explanations for the large convergence rate  increase. The post 50 Ma decrease is best explained by orogeny resistivity, decreased slab pull due to continental subduction, and possibly restrengthening  of lithosphere asthenosphere coupling upon plume demise. van Hinsbergen, D.

Both episodes of Â­ 50 Ma  induced weakening of  related increased trench J. Geophys. Res. , 116 , [ ] To analyze the effects of continental collision and 3 subduction, and its influences on topography and climate, it is essential to estimate the age of collision. Most authors Â­ prefer an age around 55 50 Ma for collision between the Tethyan Himalayas (the structurally highest, paleogeo- graphically northernmost remnants of continental Greater India) and the southernmost continental terrane of Tibet for reasons reviewed in section 2. One of these arguments, however, is derived from global plate circuits (and apparent polar wander paths constructed using those), which shows  that the India Asia convergence rate dramatically decreased   from 16 cm/yr around 50 Ma to 5 cm/yr around 35 Ma [ Molnar and Tapponnier , 1975; Klootwijk , 1984; Patriat and Achache , 1984; Besse and Courtillot , 2002; Torsvik et al. , 2008; Molnar and Stock , 2009; Copley et al. , 2010]. This rapid relative plate convergence decrease is normally suggested to be causally related to, and hence is evidence for  Â­  a 55 50 Ma onset of the India Asia collision.  [ ] When inspecting the India Asia convergence curves 4  based on the Indo Atlantic plate circuit [e.g., Torsvik et al. , 1of 20 c("""", ""B06101"", ""VAN HINSBERGEN ET AL.: INDIA"", ""ASIA CONVERGENCE RATE FLUCTUATIONS"", ""Â­"", ""2008] since the middle Cretaceous, not only the 50"", ""35 Ma"", ""Â­"", ""deceleration, (and a smaller second one around 25"", ""20 Ma"", ""["", ""Molnar and Stock"", "", 2009]) become apparent, but also an"", """", ""equally impressive acceleration since"", ""66 Ma from 8 to"", ""16 cm/yr, on a similar timescale as the slowdown [e.g.,"", ""Patriat and Achache"", "", 1984;"", ""Molnar and Stock"", "", 2009;"", ""Copley et al."", "", 2010].

However, if plumes thin the continental root and"", ""2of20"") B06101  weaken the lithosphere asthenosphere coupling [ Kumar et al. , 2007], plate motion deceleration is more likely to result from the combined effects of absolute decrease of slab pull due to continental subduction, increased resistance at the convergent plate boundary due to orogeny, and perhaps  restrenghtening of lithosphere asthenosphere coupling due to migration of the plate or the continental lithosphere away from the plume. In this case, the timing of slowdown may be used to infer continental collision. [ ] In this paper, we therefore aim to test (1) whether 11 plume head arrival is indeed likely to generate accelerations of  India Asian convergence; (2) whether the total relative plate motion rate, especially since 65 Ma, can be entirely ascribed to plume head spreading; and (3) whether the disappearance Â­  of a plume head can generate the 50 35 Ma India Asia deceleration, or whether an additional slowing factor (e.g., related to continental subduction) needs to be invoked. To this  end, we reassess the relative India Asia plate motion rates by combining relative plate motions estimated using marine geophysical data from the Atlantic and Indian oceans. Then, we show results of numerically simulated changes in plate motion induced by the arrival of a mantle plume. The maxi- mum effect is estimated with two different numerical models (one without and one with lateral viscosity variations) where the plume arrives exactly at the plate boundary. For the first model, we also assess the effect of changing plate geometry, using a realistic plate reconstruction. Finally, we discuss the influences of mantle plumes and continental collision on  India Asia relative plate motion rates. [ ] The numerical modeling results are by definition 12 "" "" expressed in terms of absolute motion, i.e., motion of the Indian plate relative to the mantle. When comparing with observed plate motions, it appears therefore most appropri- "" "" ate to also consider plate motions in an absolute reference  frame. Here we use the Indo Atlantic moving hot spot ref- ' erence frame of O Neill et al. [2005], i.e., plate motions are defined relative to hot spots, taking the observed geometry and age progression of hot spot tracks into account, but also considering that hot spots have moved relative to each other [ Molnar and Atwater , 1973]. The motion of hot spots is ' computed by O Neill et al. [2005] from a numerical model  of plume conduits embedded in large scale mantle flow. On the other hand, however, we consider for observed plate motion changes also the motion of the Indian plate relative to Eurasia, because this is what is reflected in the geological history. Furthermore, relative plate motions within the African hemisphere are known with considerably less uncertainty than absolute motions, and by looking at relative motions we hence avoid possible artifacts which may be due to the choice of the uncertain absolute reference frame. This treatment may at first sight seem inconsistent. However, we will also show that the changes in motion which we are concerned about in this paper appear in a very similar fashion in both the absolute and relative motion history, because, during the time period of interest, Eurasia has moved little with respect to the mantle compared to India. and Active Margins, and the Size of Greater India [ ] The establishment of the Indian plate by separation 13 Â­ from Gondwana occurred around 130 120 Ma, upon initi- c(""ation of seafloor spreading between India and Antarctica"", """", ""Australia ["", ""Gaina et al."", "", 2003, 2007].

[ ] When reconstructing plate motions through a plate 29 circuit, it is always desirable to put uncertainty bounds on the amount of calculated displacement. Hence, in our selection of rotation parameters for individual reconstruc-  tions involved in the India Eurasia circuit, we naturally gave preference to those studies that estimated reconstruction uncertainties through a formal statistical analysis [e.g., Stock and Molnar , 1983; Stock et al. , 1990]. The geomagnetic polarity timescale calibrations of Gradstein et al. [1994] and Cande and Kent [1995] were used to assign absolute ages in all individual reconstructions, with a switch point from the  Late Cretaceous Cenozoic timescale [ Cande and Kent , 1995] to the Mesozoic timescale [ Gradstein et al. , 1994] set to the younger edge of the Cretaceous Normal Super- chron, at 83.5 Ma, following Torsvik et al. [2008]. In the following discussion of sources for individual reconstruc- tions, we will use the polarity chron notation of Cande and "" "" "" "" Kent [1995], the y and o following the chron identifier denoting the young and old edges of the chron, respectively. [ ] The Euler rotation parameters and their uncertainties 30 for the reconstructions included in our plate circuit models 1 are presented in Table S1 of the auxiliary material. To reconstruct the Cenozoic motion of India relative to the Somalian plate, we have used most recent kinematic models of the Indian Ocean closure. These include (1) detailed  India Somalia reconstructions of Merkouriev and DeMets [2008] for the last 20 Ma (chron C6no time to the recent), (2) the estimates of Neogene deformation within the Central  Indian Basin of DeMets et al. [2005] (India Capricorn  motion), and (3) the updated kinematics of Capricorn Somalia motion recently published by Cande et al. [2010] for the time interval between chrons C13o and C29o 1 Auxiliary materials are available in the HTML. doi:10.1029/ 2010JB008051. B06101 Â­  (33.5 64.7 Ma). For the Late Cretaceous India Somalia  Â­ reconstructions (chron C30r C34y time, 67.7 83.5 Ma), we have adopted the rotation parameters of Molnar et al.  [1988]. The opening of East African Rift (Somalia Nubia motion) was reconstructed using the rotation parameters of  Horner Johnson et al. [2007] and Lemaux et al. [2002].  Similar to a recent study of India Asia convergence by Molnar and Stock [2009], we assumed that active East African rifting began approximately 11 million years ago (chron C5no), and no motion between Somalia and Nubia had occurred prior to that time. [ ] For the closure of the Atlantic Ocean, we considered 31 two alternative models involving different fits between Africa, North America and Eurasia. In the first model  (model A), we used the Africa North America rotations of MÃ¼ller et al. [1999] back to chron C34ny time (83.5 Ma),  North America Eurasia reconstructions of Gaina et al. [2002] back to chron C33no time (79.1 Ma), and the North Â­ America Eurasia rotation of Srivastava and Roest [1989] for chron C34ny. Model B is essentially the reconstruction choice of Molnar and Stock [2009], and uses rotations of McQuarrie et al. [2003] to define relative displacements between Africa, North America and Eurasia since chron C30r (67.7 Ma). For earlier time (up to 83.5 Ma), rotations of Â­ Klitgord and Schouten [1986] were used for the Africa North America motion and those of Srivastava and Roest Â­ [1989] for the North America Eurasia fit. [ ] Extending the reconstruction further back in time, we 32    switched to the India Madagascar South Africa Northwest   Africa North America Eurasia plate circuit of Torsvik et al. [2008] prior to 83.5 Ma [see Torsvik et al. , 2008, and re- ferences therein for details]. No uncertainties are available for these rotations and no attempt was made to estimate them. However, it is probable that the spatial misfits allowable for these reconstructions have the same order or magnitude as those in the oldest reconstructions (e.g., 83.5 Ma rotations)  for the two India Eurasia motion models discussed above; hence, a cumulative reconstruction error of several hundred kilometers is quite conceivable. [ ] Estimating absolute motions of India and Eurasia 33 ' relative to the Earth s mantle (Figures 2b, 3e, and 3f), we used our relative plate circuit models to reconstruct India and Eurasia relative to Africa and then added absolute ro-  tations of Africa in the moving Indo Atlantic hot spot ref- ' erence frame of O Neill et al. [2005]. [ ] Finite rotations were combined and their uncertainties 34 were estimates following the procedure of Doubrovine and Tarduno [2008].

Finally, we  observe that the post 50 Ma slowdown of Indian plate motion  is even more pronounced in the moving Indo Atlantic hot  spot reference frame, because between 50 and 25 Ma, Eur- asia moved southward with respect to the mantle (Figures 2b, 3e, and 3f).

275 vanhins jgrb16783.pdf,M,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Interaction 4.1. Method [ ] Plate motions caused by a mantle plume are 42  approximately computed with a two step approach: In the first step, the plume is numerically modeled and stresses acting at the lithosphere are computed with a fixed upper boundary. These stresses are integrated to torques for given plate geometry. In the second step, the torques are converted to plate angular velocities. This is done in a rather approx- "" imate fashion, using a scalar conversion factor or imped- "" ance described below. A more accurate treatment would require to also consider the interaction between different moving plates [e.g., Ricard and Vigny , 1989]. However, these are weaker than the interaction of plates with the underlying mantle, and our approach is sufficient for our purpose, since we are here only interested in an approximate estimate. Our approach essentially considers that torques on plates have to be balanced and determines (in a simplified way, not considering the interaction between plates across boundaries and through the mantle) the plate velocity for which this is the case. We use two different codes (referred to as code 1 and CitcomS) that solve for conservation of mass, momentum and energy with Newtonian viscous rhe- ology for numerical modeling of plumes. Equations for conservation of mass and momentum are  u Ã°Ãž Â¼ 0 Ã° 1 Ãž i ; i Ã€Ã<81> Ã€Ã<81> 2 Ã€ p Ã¾  u Ã¾ u Ã€ = u  Ã€  g  Â¼ 0 Ã° 2 Ãž i ; j j ; i k ; k ij ir ; i 3 ; i where r is (reference) density, u is velocity, p is pressure, h is viscosity, d is the Kroneker delta tensor, dr is the density ij anomaly, g is the gravitational acceleration, subscript i 10 of 20 B06101 symbolizes spatial component i and subscript ,i derivative in direction of i. That means we consider the density anomalies only for the buoyancy force term (last term) in the momentum equation, not in the conservation of mass equation. The momentum equation contains a pressure gradient term, a viscous term and a buoyancy term. The viscous term is for a Newtonian viscous rheology, the buoyancy term for vertical gravity (symbolized by d ). ir Other force terms (including inertial, Coriolis and centrifu- gal) are not considered. [ ] The conservation of energy equation is 43 Ã€Ã<81> T Ã¾ u T Â¼  T Ã¾ H = c Ã¾  gu T = c Ã¾ =  c Ã° 3a Ãž ; t i ; i ; ii p p p r  whereby T is the temperature, is thermal diffusivity, c is p heat capacity, H is the heat production rate, a is thermal F expansivity, subscript r symbolizes radial direction, and is viscous dissipation. Model parameters are listed in Table 1.  [ ] The left hand side corresponds to advection, the 44 terms on the right hand side to thermal diffusion, heat production, the difference between adiabatic heating and cooling and viscous dissipation. [ ] The first code (code 1) computes incompressible flow 45 in a spherical shell with a spherical harmonic expansion ' [ Hager and O Connell , 1981] up to degree and order l = 127. A test run with l = 255 yielded only small differences, indicating that l = 127 gives sufficient resolution. The PREM [ Dziewonski and Anderson , 1981] lower mantle parameters are used for the reference density profile r (r). This code only allows for radial viscosity variations, and we use the viscosity structure M2b of Steinberger and Calderwood [2006]. [ ] For each degree and order, the equations (1) and (2) 46 governing instantaneous flow reduce to a system of ordinary differential equations as a function of radius. Starting from initial values corresponding to the bottom boundary condi- tion, three independent solutions of the homogeneous equation and one solution of the inhomogeneous equation are propagated to the top boundary. The general solution is the sum of the inhomogeneous solution and a linear com- bination of the homogeneous solutions, and the three free parameters of the general solution are determined by matching the top boundary conditions. The appropriate  boundary condition at the core mantle boundary (CMB) is free slip, but we find that for spherical harmonic degrees higher than about l = 50, solutions grow rapidly with radius to very large values, and the solution matching the top boundary conditions cannot be determined due to numerical  roundoff. We circumvene this problem by using a no slip boundary at depth 50/l Ã— 2900 km for l &gt; 50. In the low- ermost mantle, the solution is hence only expanded up until degree 50. Since the modeled plumes are rather thick in  the high viscosity lower mantle (with very little power for degrees l &gt; 50; see Figure 1) this modification affects the solution in only a very minor way. [ ] Solving the equation for the conservation of energy 47 (3a) allows us to compute the evolution of thermal density heterogeneities forward in time. Here we do not explicitly consider temperatures, but instead advect absolute thermal dr ar density anomalies =T ; that is, thermal expansivity is th implied to vary with radius proportional to 1/ r (r). Also, the terms for viscous dissipation and the difference between c(""adiabatic heating and cooling are not considered here."", ""Instead of solving equation (3a) we hence solve"", """", ""th"", "";"", ""t"", ""Ã¾"", ""u"", ""i"", """", ""th"", "";"", ""i"", ""Â¼"", """", ""th"", "";"", ""ii"", ""Ã¾"", """", ""H"", ""="", ""c"", ""p"", ""Ã°"", ""3b"", ""Ãž"", ""The internal heating term"", ""ar"", ""H/c"", ""p"", ""is set zero here.

Computed speeds are lower here,"", ""15 of 20"") B06101 because the plume is mostly either beneath the plate, in which case some compensation between forces occurs, or it is some distance away from the plate, and because of the different plate boundary geometry. For the Morondava/ Marion plume, predicted plate speed drops as the plume moves away from the plate boundary (red continuous line in Figure 6b). The Deccan/Reunion plume (green continuous line), on the other hand, is overridden by the plate boundary after some time, and the maximum effect occurs at that time. For the Morondava/Marion plume, computed plate speed reaches values somewhat above 3 cm/yr between 60 and 90 Ma, whereas for the Deccan/Reunion plume it reaches between 5 and 6 cm/yr, between 40 and 30 Ma, corre- sponding to smaller plate area at that time. The combined effect (black line) is maximally about 7.5 cm/yr. For the Deccan/Reunion plume, the direction of predicted plate motion is typically ENE whereas the actual plate motion is more N to NNE. The difference can presumably be attrib- uted to the fact that the plate only can move freely (relative to its neighboring plates) parallel to the transform faults and is blocked in the other directions. In Figure 6 we hence plot "" "" the projection of the free plate motion on to the direction N30E, roughly parallel to the transform faults. The 70 Ma Â­ plate geometry is used for 74 60 Ma, the 60 Ma geometry Â­ "" "" 64 50 Ma etc. hence the overlapping steps in the plot. [ ] The Indian lithosphere is thin with respect to other 54 cratonic regions, and we have used its modern thickness in our computations. Kumar et al. [2007] suggested that this reduced thickness could be an effect of plume arrival, and it is possible that the thickness of the Indian lithosphere directly at the moment of plume arrival was much larger. If ` ' so, the Indian keel into the mantle was deeper, and the coupling between the lithosphere and asthenosphere may have been stronger. We have run our models for different lithospheric thicknesses, from 150 to 400 km, and found that the increase in predicted plate speed due to greater litho- sphere thickness is rather small and not qualitatively affecting our conclusions."
275 vanhins jgrb16783.pdf,RD,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Discussion [ ] Our results indicate that the Morondava and Deccan 55 plumes may each have contributed a few cm/yr to the velocity increase and decrease of the Indian plate. They cause a force on the plate in a similar direction as the force due to subduction, and therefore may cause an increase in plate speed of a few cm/yr. Our results show that a drop of plate speed following the initial increase does not neces- sarily require an increased resistance against plate motion but may simply reflect a drop in the driving force caused by the plume. Such a drop may be caused by (1) the plate moving away from the plume, (2) substantially reduced plume flux after initial eruption of the plume head, (3) reduced coupling between plate and mantle, if the plume causes a viscosity decrease in the asthenosphere. Comparison with observations indicates that the effect of plumes is by itself, in the case of Morondava perhaps, but in the case of Deccan almost certainly not, sufficient to explain the observed speedups and slowdowns of plate motion. [ ] The discrepancy is aggravated, as our estimate is 56 probably rather an upper limit, because (1) computed "" "" plumes are rather massive, at least in the model without c(""lateral viscosity variations, at the upper limit of what is"", ""compatible with seismic tomography; (2) other estimates"", ""indicate that the mass flux of plumes may be smaller than in"", ""our models; (3) for the plumes modeled here, computed"", ""dynamic topography is also rather large, compared to what"", ""is inferred from observations; and (4) computed plate speeds"", ""are for free plate motion; if the plate faces increased resis-"", ""tance elsewhere once it moves faster, the effect of plumes on"",

The general  assumption that India Asia convergence rate decrease since  50 Ma results from collision seems therefore to be valid."
275 vanhins jgrb16783.pdf,C,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Summary and Conclusions [ ] A popular argument to assess the age of collision 66  between India and Asia concerns the 50 Ma onset of  dramatic slowdown in the India Asia convergence rate,  from 16 cm/yr to 5 cm/yr around 35 Ma. However, this  argument does not take into account that between 65 and 50 Ma an almost equally impressive acceleration of the  India Asia convergence rate occurred, following the extru- sion of the Deccan LIP and the separation of India away  from the Seychelles microcontinent. A similar speed up episode, although of smaller magnitude, may be related to the emplacement of the Morondova LIP, and the separation between India and Madagascar. In this paper, we reassess  the Indo Atlantic plate circuit and confirm these fluctuations  in relative India Asia convergence rates. [ ] Using two different numerical models (one without 67 and one with lateral viscosity variations) where the plume arrives exactly at the plate boundary, we assess whether plume head arrival and lateral sublithospheric flow induced by these can explain the convergence rate accelerations in  the Indo Asia convergence history. In addition, we test whether subsequent convergence rate decreases can be ex- plained by the combined effect of decreased plume flux and motion of the Indian continent away from the plume. [ ] We conclude that plume head arrival may indeed 68  increase the India Asia convergence rate by several cm/yr, and that plume flux decrease and motion of India away from the plume may lead to a deceleration. The 90 Ma acceler- ation may perhaps entirely be explained by the effects of plume head arrival. [ ] The convergence rate increase following the arrival 69 of the Deccan plume some 66 Ma ago from 8 to 16 cm/yr is much larger than can be explained by our modeling results. The large velocity increase may be best explained by Â­ increased ridge push slab pull effects due to weakening of  the lithosphere asthenosphere boundary below the Indian continent, as postulated by Kumar et al. [2007]. Although part of the convergence rate decrease following 50 Ma may be attributed to plume flux decrease and motion of India away from the plume head, the bulk of convergence rate decrease is likely resulting from increased resistance at the  convergent margin due to the Tibetan Himalayan orogeny, decreased slab pull forces due to continental subduction, and perhaps the asthenosphere getting stronger again, as the plate moved away from the plume. Unless future work shows that this last effect alone is sufficient to explain the  entire slowdown, the India Asia convergence rate decrease starting around 50 Ma can hence be used as an argument to infer the arrival of Greater Indian continental lithosphere in a Â­ subduction zone around 55 50 Ma.

Conrad Received 12 August 2012; revised 2 April 2013; accepted 5 April 2013; published 16 May 2013. We used a thermal model of an iron core to calculate magnetodynamo evolution in [ ] 1 Earth-mass rocky planets to determine the sensitivity of dynamo lifetime and intensity to planets with different mantle tectonic regimes, surface temperatures, and core properties. The heat flow at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) is derived from numerical models of mantle convection with a viscous/pseudoplastic rheology that captures the phenomenology of plate-like tectonics. Our thermal evolution models predict a long-lived ( 8 Gyr) field for Earth and similar dynamo evolution for Earth-mass exoplanets with plate tectonics. Both elevated surface temperature and pressure-dependent mantle viscosity reduce the CMB heat flow but produce only slightly longer-lived dynamos ( 8Â­9.5 Gyr). Single-plate (""stagnant lid"") planets with relatively low CMB heat flow produce long-lived ( 10.5 Gyr) dynamos. These weaker dynamos can cease for several billions of years and subsequently reactivate due to the additional entropy production associated with inner core growth, a possible explanation for the absence of a magnetic field on present-day Venus. We also show that dynamo operation is sensitive to the initial temperature, size, and solidus of a planet's core. These dependencies would severely challenge any attempt to distinguish exoplanets with plate tectonics and stagnant lids based on the presence or absence of a magnetic field.

From an earthquake hazards standpoint, SSEs are important to monitor and understand, particularly given the possibility that an SSE could trigger a damaging sub- duction interface earthquake within the nearby velocity weakening portion of the plate interface [e.g., Ito et al. , 2012; Kato et al. , 2012]. [ ] Numerical models incorporating rate and state friction 3 laws that successfully reproduce SSE behavior require that the dimensionless a and b values (which describe rate- dependent variations in friction) have values where b is only slightly larger than a (e.g., slightly rate weakening) [e.g., Liu and Rice , 2005, 2007]. In other words, the frictional prop- erties of rocks that host SSEs are conditionally stable, straddling the threshold between velocity/rate strengthening (aseismic behavior, a &gt; b ) and velocity/rate weakening behavior (seismic slip behavior, b &gt; a ). Models based on rate and state friction also require extremely low effective stress 1of 18 c(""to reproduce episodic SSE behavior, suggesting that high"", ""fluid pressures are needed to generate SSEs ["", ""Liu and Rice"", "","", ""2005, 2007].

279 wallace jgrb17354.pdf,M,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Continuous GPS Data Analysis [ ] The cGPS and seismic network in New Zealand is 8 installed and operated by the New Zealand GeoNet project (Figure 2). Further information on the network and the basic data are available at www.geonet.org.nz. GPS data proces- sing methods are outlined on the GeoNet Web site and described more fully in Wallace and Beavan [2010]. We analyze the cGPS data using Bernese v5.0 [ Dach et al. , 2007] software holding IGS orbits and Earth orientation parameters fixed. The processing has been updated from Wallace and Beavan [2010] in that we now use IGS08 orbits (or IG1 reprocessed orbits and IGS05 final orbits prior to the start of IGS08), and IGS08 antenna and satellite phase patterns (see http://acc.igs.org/igsacc_general.html for further infor- mation on these data sources). The resulting daily coordinate time series are regionally filtered [ Wdowinski et al. , 1997; Beavan , 2005] using a set of NZ stations that have close to Â­ linear behavior over the 2002 2011 time period. Regionally 3of 18 B11402 filtered time series for each site are available to view at www. geonet.org.nz/resources/gps/timeseries, though these are not identical to the time series used in this analysis. The approach we use to estimate the displacements in the time series due to the SSEs is described in Wallace and Beavan [2010]. In brief, the three coordinate time series for each station are examined by eye to select a set of time periods when no slow slip is affecting that station (see Figure 3). A linear regression line is fit to each of these sections and the weighted mean slope of the lines is defined as the inter-SSE velocity. This velocity is subtracted from the time series, which are then examined by eye to identify the start and end times of slow slip events. A semiautomated algorithm smooths the time series and picks their values at the start and end of each event for each station affected by that event. For some events we split the event into sections based on changes in the character of the time series and pick the amplitudes at these times. This enables us to roughly follow the time evolution of the event. [ ] We estimate slip on the subduction interface during 9 the SSEs using a program called DEFNODE [ McCaffrey , 1995, 2002] to invert horizontal and vertical GPS site dis- placements for slip on the subduction interface. We assume c(""that surface displacements are due to dislocations in an"", ""elastic half space, using the equations of"", ""Okada"", ""[1992]."", ""Rather than explicitly solving for the amount of slip at each"", ""of the nodes or patches defining the interface, we invert for"", ""three parameters describing a Gaussian function along sep-"", ""arate down-dip profiles to estimate the depth and magnitude"", ""of the maximum slip and the spread of the slip [e.g.,"", ""Subarya"", ""et al."", "", 2006].

This approach captures the"", ""details of the event using fewer free parameters per event"", ""than if we solve for slip at individual nodes or fault patches."", ""One drawback to this approach is evident when there is more"", ""than one distinct patch of slip occurring along the same"", ""down-dip profile.

September/October portions of the sequence, following a similar spatial and temporal pattern to a previous SSE sequence in that area that occurred in early 2010 [ Wallace and Beavan , 2010]. SSE Sequence [ ] In addition to marked cGPS displacements onshore, 18 an intriguing cluster of earthquakes took place during the June/July slow slip events. On around 21 June, at the start of the June/July 2011 SSE, a sequence of M 2-M 3 earth- L L  quakes occurred 30 km offshore of the east coast (www. 9of 18 B11402 geonet.org./nz/resources/earthquake/), detected by the New Zealand GeoNet seismometer network. More than 70 events  followed, through to 8 July, including several M 4 events, L and a M 5.0 (M 4.8) event on 4 July, 08:36 UTC. The L w earthquake hypocenters clearly migrate northward over the Â­ 2-week period, at a rate of 6 9 km/day, tracking the north- ward migration of the slow slip event determined from the Â­ cGPS inversions (Figures 8 9). More detailed examination of the continuous seismological data indicate a total of  120 events, over a 2-week period, with a tight cluster of events occurring between 1 July and 4 July located on the southwest side of the second SSE subepisode (Figure 9). Moment tensor solutions were obtained by GeoNet (www. geonet.org./nz/resources/earthquake/) for the largest two events in this subepisode (Figure 9), using the method devel- oped at the University of California, Berkeley Seismological Laboratory [ Dreger and Helmberger , 1993; Dreger , 2003; Ristau , 2008]. These solutions indicate thrust faulting, with a small strike-slip component. [ ] The cumulative moment produced by microseismicity 19 during the June/July portion of the East Coast sequence is 1.8e+17 Nm, while the equivalent moment released in the June/July SSE (determined geodetically) is 1.8e+19 Nm. The microseismicity only accounts for 1% of the SSE slip, indicating that the vast majority of the geodetically deter- mined slip is aseismic. Although tremor during the 2011 East Coast sequence has not yet been clearly identified, we cannot rule it out at this stage. The mix of microseismicity and slow slip within the southern portion of the East Coast sequence indicates strong heterogeneity of frictional prop- erties and physical conditions on the subduction interface there. In many ways this coexisting slow slip and micro- seismicity is analogous to similar processes observed on the Japan Trench in the source region of the March 2011 M 9.0 w earthquake [ Ito et al. , 2012; Kato et al. , 2012]."
279 wallace jgrb17354.pdf,RD,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Coast Sequences [ ] We have also searched the time series of the southeast 20 coastal cGPS sites to determine if any events similar to the June/July 2011 event had occurred in the past. The first cGPS site (CAST) was installed in this region in 2006, so it is not possible to identify SSEs here prior to 2006. We have identified one possible candidate for a smaller SSE in  December 2009, when 5 mm east to southeast displace- ment occurred at sites TEMA, CAST, and TRAV (Figures 6 and 10). Inversion for slip in this late 2009/early 2010 event (assuming a subduction interface source) requires slip on the interface just to the south of the June/July 2011 SSE (Figure 10). Intriguingly, this SSE occurred just offshore, in a region where the plate interface currently appears to be locked (see discussion in section 5.2). [ ] Seismicity clusters have also been observed in the past 21 Â­ in the same location as for June July 2011, for example in Â­ Â­ September October 2006, and in September October 2001 (Figure 11). The 2006 cluster coincides with (and is slightly ' preceded by) an SSE in southern Hawke s Bay that occurred from late August until early September 2006 [ Wallace and Beavan , 2010].

We infer that, Â­ Â­ as for June July 2011 and September October 2006, the seismicity cluster in 2001 could also have been associated with SSE deformation, before the onshore continuous GPS network was fully established. If so, this suggests an approxi- mately 5-year recurrence interval between SSEs (and associated Â­ microseismicity) in the region of the June July 2011 SSE in ' the southern Hawke s Bay region. Note that the December 2009 SSE further south (Figure 10) does not appear to have associated microseismicity (Figure 11). Discussion 5.1. Triggering of the East Coast Sequence by the Manawatu SSE? [ ] Numerous studies have noted the relationship between 22 an increase in static Coulomb stress change following an earthquake and the distribution of aftershocks, suggesting that some aftershocks are triggered by these static stress changes ( Stein and Lisowski [1983], Toda et al. [1998], and Anderson and Johnson [1999], among many others). More- over, many studies have documented dynamic triggering of tremor episodes by passing surface waves ( Peng et al. [2009], Rubinstein et al. [2009], and Fry et al. [2011], among others). Additional studies have suggested triggering of SSEs by earthquakes due to either static [e.g., Brooks et al. , 2008] or dynamic [e.g., Johnson et al. , 2012] stress changes. The 2011 East Coast SSE sequence initiated in June/July, just updip of the region of ongoing slip in the Manawatu SSE (Figure 12). The spatial and temporal rela- tionship between the two SSEs suggests the possibility that the redistribution of plate boundary stresses that occurred during the Manawatu SSE actually triggered the initiation of the East Coast sequence, toward the end of the 2010/2011 Manawatu SSE. To test this idea, we calculate the change in Coulomb failure stress (CFS) on the subduction interface in the region of the Manawatu SSE. [ ] To perform our analysis, we used the finite element 23 code PyLith [ Williams et al. , 2005; Williams , 2006; Aagaard et al. , 2007, 2008], which can compute stresses on the fault surface for a given slip distribution. We apply the inferred slip distribution for the 2010/2011 Manawatu SSE and then compute the CFS changes on the subduction interface, assuming a shear direction consistent with the plate con- vergence direction [ Wallace and Beavan , 2010]. The results of our Coulomb stress calculations are shown in Figure 13. For our calculations we used a relatively low effective fric- tion coefficient of 0.2, since we assume that pore fluid pressures are relatively high; however, the results do not change significantly when we assume a value of 0.4. Also, since CFS calculations are strongly dependent on small variations in the applied slip, we use a simplified version of the geodetically inferred slip distribution where all slip values less than 1 cm are set to zero. This allows us to focus on the broader-scale features of the stress change patterns. [ ] The overall effect of the 2010/2011 Manawatu SSE 24 is to produce CFS increases on the order of 1 kPa near the maximum slip regions of the June/July 2011 phase of the East Coast sequence and on the order of 10 kPa near the downdip end of the June/July 2011 slip area (Figure 13). Since the computed stress is a function of the derivative of the applied slip, the CFS calculations are strongly dependent c(""on the details of the assumed fault slip. This is reflected in"", ""Figure 13 as small-scale fluctuations between positive and"", ""negative values in CFS due to slight gradients in the applied"", ""slip. Small-scale slip gradients are not well resolved by the"", ""cGPS data, so these small-scale variations in CFS are not"", ""necessarily real. Despite these uncertainties, there is a clear"", ""region of increased CFS surrounding the location of the"", ""2010/2011 Manawatu SSE, and this region of increased CFS"", 
""coincides with the initiation location of the East Coast"", ""sequence near Cape Turnagain."", ""["", ""25"", ""] Although the static stress change from the Manawatu"", ""SSE within the source area of the June/July 2011 episode is"", ""small (1"", ""Â­"", ""10 kPa), it is comparable to dynamic stress changes"", ""(tens of kPa, due to passing surface waves) associated with"", ""many cases of dynamically triggered tremor [e.g.,"", ""Peng"", ""et al."", "", 2009;"", ""Rubinstein et al."", "", 2009;"", ""Fry et al."", "", 2011].

Overall, we expect that the different character of the short duration SSEs beneath the East Coast versus the long-term SSEs in the Man- awatu and Kapiti regions is due to differences in interface het- erogeneity and effective normal stress between the two areas. 5.5. Implications for the Frictional Properties of the Interface Beneath the Manawatu and Southern Hawkes Bay Regions [ ] The 2010/2011 sequence of SSEs beneath the 39 Manawatu and east coast demonstrates that nearly the entire ' plate interface in the Manawatu and southern Hawke s Bay  region (from 60 km depth, to &lt;10 km depth) undergoes slow slip. This implies that the interface at the central Hikurangi margin possesses the physical conditions that promote SSE behavior over a &gt;240 km wide region (in the strike-normal direction) and spanning most, if not all, of its depth range &lt;60 km. We also cannot rule out the possibility ' that SSE slip in southern Hawke s Bay continues to the trench; the trenchward extent of SSE slip is not resolvable here due to the lack of offshore geodetic coverage, so the width of the SSE region could be even larger than we sug- gest here. [ ] To reproduce SSE behavior, numerical modeling 40 studies require conditional frictional stability (e.g., where b is only slightly larger than a or slightly velocity weakening) and very low effective stress probably due to high pore fluid pressure [ Liu and Rice , 2005, 2007]. Thus although numer- ical modeling studies require very specific frictional para- meters and fluid pressure conditions to reproduce SSE behavior, the physical conditions required for SSE behavior appear to be operating over most of the central Hikurangi subduction interface. Observations of long-duration earth- quakes at a number of shallow subduction zones also sug- gest that conditional frictional stability may in fact be common at other subduction interfaces [ Bilek and Lay , 2002]. It is also possible that other processes not accounted for in these numerical models (which are only based on rate and state friction) may be operating to produce slow slip behavior over such a broad depth range. Previously pro- posed mechanisms such as dilatant strengthening at the onset of slip [ Segall et al. , 2010] and rate-dependent changes in velocity weakening versus velocity strengthening behavior [ Shibazaki and Shimamoto , 2007] could help to broaden the window of physical conditions that promote SSE occurrence."
279 wallace jgrb17354.pdf,C,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Conclusions [ ] We document two distinct SSE sequences at the Hikur- 41 angi margin during the 2010/2011 period: (1) a long-duration Â­ (1.5 years), deep (25 60 km) SSE and (2) a sequence of short Â­ SSEs (lasting 1 3 weeks) on the shallow plate interface just offshore the east coast (at &lt;15 km depth) during the last half of 2011. Slip in the 2010/2011 Manawatu SSE was similar to its less-constrained predecessor, the 2004/2005 Manawatu SSE. The 2011 East Coast sequence began at the southern Hikur-  angi margin, offshore Castlepoint, and migrated 300 km along-strike in a highly irregular fashion between June and December 2011. Microseismicity accompanied the early por- tion of the East Coast sequence and closely tracked the northward migration of SSE slip in the first month, with the WALLACE ET AL.: HIKURANGI MARGIN SLOW SLIP EVENTS B11402 seismic activity appearing to occur concurrently with the onset of SSE deformation (within the resolution of the available GPS data).  [ ] It is clear that a large depth range (from 60 km 42 depth to &lt;10 km) of the central Hikurangi interface &gt;200 km wide (in the strike-normal direction) underwent slow slip during both the long-term and short-term sequences in 2010/ 2011. This observation suggests that the physical environ- ments that can host SSE are inherently broad and that con- ditionally stable frictional behavior can occur over a wide region in the down-dip direction. On the basis of the location and timing of the 2010/2011 Manawatu and 2011 East Coast SSEs, we suggest that the East Coast SSE sequence was triggered by the long-term, deeper event. The earliest stages of the East Coast sequence were accompanied by abundant microseismicity and involved slip just updip of the strongly locked portion of the plate interface (Figure 11). This may be the first, well-documented example of an SSE at the updip transition from seismic to aseismic behavior. Alternatively, the occurrence of SSE slip updip of the interseismically locked interface may be characteristic of a region of partial (e.g., coupling coefficient &lt;1.0) interseismic coupling. Comparison of our results with properties of the subduction interface (from active source seismic studies [ Bell et al. , 2010]) suggest that heterogeneous interface properties may promote shorter duration SSEs and highly irregular SSE migration behavior.

280 wang jgrb50828.pdf,I,Journal of Geophysical Research,"1. Introduction The M 7.6 Kashmir earthquake occurred on 8 October 2005 in the northwestern Himalaya. This area represents w fi a tectonic boundary resulted from the India-Eurasia collision and is characterized by signi cant seismicity [e.g., Bilham , 2001]. The 2005 Kashmir earthquake is the latest and largest seismic event to date that occurred along the Himalaya arc since the advent of modern space geodesy. The coseismic deformation due to this earthquake has been studied extensively using both geodetic [ Avouac et al ., 2006; Pathier et al ., 2006; Yan et al ., 2013] and seismic [ Avouac et al ., 2006; Parsons et al ., 2006] observations. Although there are some variations among the proposed rupture models in terms of rupture geometry and slip distribution, all models suggest that the 2005 Kashmir earthquake ruptured a ~70 km long NE dipping fault with primarily thrust mechanism, with minor component of right-lateral slip, consistent with seismic moment tensor solution determined from modeling of long-period surface waves. In this study, we investigate surface deformation over several years following the earthquake. Spatiotemporal patterns of postseismic deformation may provide valuable information about mechanical properties of the lithosphere [e.g., Pollitz et al ., 2000; Fialko , 2004a; BÃ¼rgmann and Dresen , 2008]. Several mechanisms are often invoked to explain the observed transients following large earthquakes, including afterslip, viscoelastic relaxation, and poroelastic rebound [e.g., Burgmann et al ., 2002; Fialko , 2004a; Barbot et al ., 2008, 2009]. It is fi often dif cult to separate contributions from different mechanisms due to similar patterns of surface motion, especially in case of strike-slip earthquake [e.g., Savage , 1990; Barbot et al ., 2009]. Dip-slip earthquakes, on the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011122 fi other hand, may give rise to distinct pattern of surface displacements that can be readily identi ed in the geodetic data [e.g., Nishimura and Thatcher , 2003; Yu et al ., 2003]. Unfortunately, only limited ground-based observations of postseismic deformation due to the 2005 Kashmir fi earthquake are available because of the dif cult access and mountainous terrain in the epicentral area. Based on data from a campaign-mode GPS survey of 18 sites, Jouanne et al . [2011] estimated the temporal-spatial fl evolution of postseismic deformation. They argued that the GPS data are consistent with afterslip along a at dÃ©collement beneath the main rupture. Most of the GPS measurements with high signal-to-noise ratio were fi Â­ made within ~50 km from the rupture during the rst 2 years (2005 2007) after the earthquake. In this study, we complement the available GPS data with C-band Envisat and L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite Â­ Â­ (ALOS) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations spanning 2005 2010 and 2007 2009, respectively, to characterize the surface deformation over a longer time period and at higher spatial resolution. We compare the observed surface deformation to predictions of models assuming afterslip, viscoelastic relaxation, and poroelastic redound to place constraints on the effective mechanical properties of lithosphere in the collision zone between the Indian and Eurasian plates."
280 wang jgrb50828.pdf,M,Journal of Geophysical Research,"2.1. Envisat The C-band Envisat data used in this study are from the ascending track T499 (average incidence angle of 41Â°) and of descending track T463 (average incident angle of 23Â°). Because of the rugged topography and precipitation in the epicentral area, interferograms suffer from severe decorrelation. To mitigate the problem of geometric and temporal decorrelation, we analyzed the Envisat data using persistent scatter (PS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique [e.g., Ferretti et al ., 2000; Hooper et al ., 2004, 2007]. There are fi 30 scenes available for the ascending track T499, with the rst acquisition on 24 October 2005 (about 2 weeks after the earthquake) and last acquisition on 31 May 2010. The descending track T463 has 17 scenes, fi with rst acquisition on 22 October 2005 and last acquisition on 13 June 2009. Figure S1 shows the baseline plots for the respective tracks. We processed the data using StaMPS v3.2 [ Hooper et al ., 2009]. Default fi parameters (e.g., 800 m cutoff wavelength for low-pass ltering in the space domain and 2 years time window for phase smoothing in the time domain) were used unless noted otherwise. The resulting average line-of-sight (LOS) velocities for the respective tracks T499 and T463 are shown in Figures 2a and 2b, with positive LOS displacements corresponding to surface movement toward the satellite. Data from both tracks yield comparable rate (~cm/yr) of LOS surface movement toward the satellite, primarily on the hanging wall side of the fault. We note that depending on the choice of processing parameters, for example, selection of the master scene, noise threshold, averaging window in the spatial domain, etc., the magnitude of the average LOS velocity can vary by a factor of 2 to 3. For instance, changing the value of a parameter for smoothing the spatially correlated noise in temporal domain, from a default value of 2 years to 0.5 year, increases the LOS velocity in the hanging wall to ~25 mm/yr (cf. Figure 2b). Using a shorter time window for smoothing might be desirable to better characterize the time dependence of postseismic relaxation; however, the resulting LOS velocity is fi much noisier in the space domain. Also, we found that the deformation accumulated during the rst 2 years Â­ Â­ after the earthquake (2005 2007) is smaller than that accumulated during a later period (2007 2010). This may be due to the residual atmospheric artifacts or some other noise. We thus chose to use a default time window fi (2 years) for the temporal noise ltering to better characterize the average LOS velocity and the spatial pattern of surface deformation. The radar phase from all unwrapped interferograms was then added and divided by the cumulative time span of the respective interferograms to yield the average LOS velocity during the Â­ Â­ period of Envisat observations (2005 2010 for ascending track T499 and 2005 2009 for descending track T463). 2.2. ALOS The L-band ALOS data used in this study are from three frames (F660, F670, and F680) of the ascending track T530 (average incidence angle of ~39Â°), covering the entire rupture (Figure 1). There are 18 acquisitions over a time period from 2007 to 2011 (see Figure S1 for the baseline plot). We processed the raw SAR data using GMTSAR software [ Sandwell et al ., 2011]. All interferometric pairs satisfy the following criteria: (1) perpendicular baselines less than 700 m, (2) time intervals greater than 1 year, and (3) low root-mean-square (RMS) of interferograms after fi subtracting the mean radar phase. These criteria are met for a subset of ve interferograms with the earliest scene acquired on 17 February 2007 and last scene acquired on 25 August 2009.

Figure 3 shows the LOS velocities from fi different satellite tracks along a pro le perpendicular to the earthquake rupture. Data from both ALOS track T530 and Envisat ascending track T499 suggest a relatively sharp discontinuity in surface displacements across the fault. The across-fault variations in the LOS velocity fi are less apparent in the pro le from the Envisat descending track T463, possibly due to a destructive interference of the Figure 3. LOS velocities from different satellite tracks (colored circles) fi and topography (gray shading) along the pro le shown by the dashed vertical and horizontal displacements fi black line in Figure 2. The LOS velocity pro les have been shifted along the radar line of sight (Figure 2a). vertically for better visualization. Also, we note that the LOS velocities from the descending Envisat track 463 may be subject to greater uncertainties due to a fewer acquisitions compared to the ascending track 499 (Figure 2b). The standard deviation of the mean LOS velocity is ~3 mm/yr for the Envisat data. For the ALOS fi data, the uncertainty is more dif cult to quantify due to a relatively small number of interferograms used for stacking, but it should be comparable to that of the Envisat data based on the scatter of individual data points from the mean (Figure 3). As the same general pattern of LOS velocity is seen in all satellite tracks with different look geometries and time periods, the signals shown in Figure 2 are indicative of surface displacements. Interseismic crustal shortening across the Balakot-Bagh thrust (the main rupture of the 2005 M 7.6 Kashmir earthquake) is w Â­ estimated to be slow, at a rate of 1.1 4.1 mm/yr [ Kaneda et al ., 2008], and has a negligible contribution to the LOS velocities shown in Figure 2. The latter therefore most likely represents postseismic deformation due to the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. In the next section, we will quantitatively analyze the surface displacement fi elds due to various mechanisms (viscoelastic relaxation, poroelastic rebound, and afterslip) and compare them to the observations to explore what mechanism (or a combination of mechanisms) may have contributed to postseismic deformation following the 2005 Kashmir earthquake."
280 wang jgrb50828.pdf,RD,Journal of Geophysical Research,"3.1. Viscoelastic Relaxation fi We estimate viscoelastic response due to the Kashmir earthquake using a nite element model. As little is known about the lithospheric structure in the Kashmir region, we assume a simple structure consisting of a 20 km thick elastic layer and viscoelastic substrate with linear Maxwell rheology. More complicated models accounting for nonlinear depth-dependent [e.g., Freed et al ., 2010; Takeuchi and Fialko , 2013] and spatially heterogeneous [e.g., Rousset et al ., 2012] rheologies are not warranted given the limited data resolution. The fi simulations were performed using the nite element code ABAQUS (www.simulia.com/products/abaqus_fea. html). The dimension of the model is 800 km Ã— 600 km Ã— 150 km in strike-parallel, strike-perpendicular, and vertical directions, respectively. Zero-displacement boundary conditions are applied at all sides of the model fi except the top side which is assumed to be stress free. To better resolve the displacement and stress elds close to the fault, the size of the elements gradually increases away from the earthquake rupture. The model contains 1,226,468 tetrahedron elements with near-fault elements as small as ~0.5 km. Several coseismic slip models are available for the 2005 Kashmir earthquake from inversions of geodetic fi and seismic data. We use two published nite fault models: Avouac et al . [2006] hereafter referred to as "" "" "" "" model A, and Yan et al . [2013], hereafter referred to as model Y. Slip distribution is imposed using a split node technique similar to that used by Masterlark [2003]. To directly compare the model predictions to the InSAR-observed surface velocities (Figure 2), we compute the predicted average surface velocity by Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011122 Figure 4. Predicted surface deformation velocity due to the viscoelastic relaxation in the lower crust and upper mantle with 19 effective viscosity of 10 Pa s. The predicted LOS velocity map is obtained by stacking the differential displacements using the intervals corresponding to the SAR interferograms. The sign convention for LOS velocities (positive for decreases in radar Â­ range and negative for increases in radar range) is the same as in Figure 2. (a c) Based upon the coseismic slip model of Â­ Avouac et al . [2006]. (d f) Based upon the coseismic slip model of Yan et al . [2013]. summing up the differences in surface displacements between the time intervals corresponding to the SAR acquisition dates and divide by the sum of the respective time intervals. The resulting surface velocity is then projected onto the line of sight (LOS) of the satellite to yield the predicted average LOS velocity. Â­ Â­ Figure 4 (Figures 4a 4c are based on model A, and Figures 4d 4f are based on model Y) shows the predicted average LOS velocities due to viscoelastic relaxation assuming the effective viscosity of the 19 substrate of 10 Pa s. For both Envisat and ALOS tracks, the viscoelastic relaxation models predict increases in radar range that vary continuously across the fault, in contrast to the observed range changes 19 (Figure 2). For the effective viscosity of 10 Pa s, the model predicts increase in radar range at a rate of Â­ ~4 cm/yr during the Envisat observation period (2005 2010); the rate decreases to ~3 cm/yr during the Â­ fi ALOS observation period (2007 2009). The surface velocity elds predicted for the coseismic model Y appear to be more symmetric with respect to the fault and more uniformly distributed along the fault strike from north to the south, compared to the velocities corresponding to model A. These differences are primarily due to the steeper dip angle and more broadly distributed slip in model Y. Changing the viscosity of the substrate affects the average velocity but does not change the overall pattern of surface motion. To examine the sensitivity of LOS velocity to the thickness of viscoelastic layer, we performed a simulation 19 assuming a 20 km thick elastic crust, a 40 km thick lower crust with viscosity of 10 Pa s, and elastic mantle. The LOS velocity in this case is slightly lower and of shorter wavelength, compared to the model shown in Figure 4. We note that the surface subsidence predicted by both models monotonically increases fi (and decelerates) with time, indicating that the surface deformation eld due to viscoelastic relaxation fi should exhibit a similar pattern during the whole postseismic phase. The signi cant differences in surface deformation patterns between observations (Figure 2) and models (Figure 4) thus suggest that viscoelastic relaxation was not the dominant mechanism responsible for transient deformation following the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. 3.2. Poroelastic Rebound We evaluate surface displacements due to poroelastic rebound by differencing the coseismic displacements under undrained and drained conditions. The predicted surface displacements due to poroelastic rebound in the 20 km thick upper crust projected on the line of sight of Envisat and ALOS are shown in Figure 5 Â­ Â­ ' (Figures 5a 5c correspond to model A, while Figures 5d 5f correspond to model Y). We use a Poisson s ratio reduction of 0.03 (from undrained value of 0.28 to drained value of 0.25). The poroelastic rebound model based on both coseismic models (models A and Y) shows decreases in the radar range up to ~5 cm for both Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011122 ' Figure 5. Predicted surface deformation velocity due to the poroelastic rebound in the top 20 km of Earth s crust, calculated by differencing the coseismic deformation under undrained and drained conditions. Envisat and ALOS tracks, in a qualitative agreement with the data (Figure 2). However, the poroelastic model predicts a relatively symmetric uplift (decrease in radar range) on both sides of the fault, while the InSAR data suggest that the uplift is primarily concentrated in the hanging wall, although a small amount of uplift ' may also occur in the footwall (Figures 2 and 3). We note that variations in the reduction of Poisson s ratio fl fi and depth extent of uid-saturated layer do not alter the surface deformation pattern signi cantly and only affect the magnitude of surface deformation. By comparing the InSAR observations (Figure 2) and modeling results (Figures 4 and 5), one can conclude that the viscoelastic and poroelastic responses are not able to explain the InSAR data and alternative mechanisms must be involved. 3.3. Afterslip The general pattern of postseismic deformation imaged by InSAR data (uplift in the hanging wall and a relatively sharp discontinuity in LOS velocities across the fault; see Figures 2 and 3) is suggestive of a continued slip on the earthquake rupture. To get an insight into the spatial distribution of afterslip on the rupture plane, we performed an inversion using the LOS velocities derived from ALOS and GPS measurements from Jouanne et al . [2011]. The fault geometry is based on the coseismic slip model of Avouac et al . [2006]. We extended the fault segments both in strike and dip directions. We assumed that the fault has a dip angle of 29Â° down to depth of 15 km and transitions to a dÃ©collement with a dip angle of 10Â° below 15 km [ Jouanne et al ., 2011]. The total downdip width of the fault is 60 km. The kinked fault planes were then divided into patches whose sizes gradually increase with depth to ensure a uniform model resolution [ Fialko , 2004b]. Each individual patch is allowed to have thrust and right-lateral slip components. Laplacian smoothing is applied between adjacent fault patches to avoid abrupt variations in slip. The inversion problem is further regularized by requiring no slip at the fault edges, except the top edge, which is allowed to slip. This leads to a classical minimization problem for fi the mis t function: 2 ;  Ã°Ãž Â¼ jj Ã€ jj Ã¾  jj  jj (1) Fm Gm d m  2 where m is the vector of unknown (slip) components, d is the data vector, G is the matrix of Green functions, is fi  the nite different approximation of the Laplacian operator used to smooth the model, and is a smoothing factor. We use Green functions for a dislocation in a homogeneous elastic half-space [ Okada , 1985]. To reduce the computational burden, the average LOS velocity map (Figure 2c) is subsampled using a gradient-based resampling scheme [e.g., JÃ³nsson et al ., 2002]. Each resulting data point is then assigned with a weight based on the number of points in the subsampled area [e.g., Simons et al ., 2002; Fialko , 2004b]. To minimize possible contributions from the postevent seismic activity in the Indus Kohistan Seismic Zone to the northwest of the Kashmir rupture [e.g. Khwaja et al ., 2009], data west of 73.3Â°E longitude were excluded from the inversion. c(""The optimal value of"", """", ""controlling the"", ""smoothness of the model was"", ""determined using the trade-off relation"", ""between the model mis"", ""fi"", ""t(residual of"", ""model prediction and observation) and"", ""the roughness (1/"", """", "") of the corresponding"", ""model (Figure 6).

Comparison of surface deformation elds between Envisat observations and afterslip model predictions. (a c) Â­ For the ascending track 499. (d f) For the descending track 463. Note that the original average LOS velocities have been scaled by a constant (see the text). (Figure 8b). Overall, the observed uplift on the hanging wall side of the fault has been recovered by the model. Figure 11 shows the comparison of horizontal displacements at the GPS sites of Jouanne et al. [2011] (extrapolated and averaged velocities corresponding to the ALOS observation period) and predictions of afterslip, viscoelastic relaxation, and poroelastic rebound models. The overall good agreement between the fi data and predictions of the afterslip model suggests that deformation during the rst several years following the 2005 Kashmir earthquake was dominated by afterslip on the earthquake rupture. The spatial pattern of Â­ afterslip appears to have persisted over the period of observations (2005 2010). We also compared predictions of afterslip model derived from joint inversion of ALOS and GPS data to Envisat observations spanning ~4.5 years immediately after the earthquake. The surface deformation patterns revealed by the Envisat observation are used as an independent check on model predictions. Because of different time periods covered by the data, and substantial (up to a factor of 2 to 3) dependence of the mean LOS velocities on parameters used in the persistent scatter InSAR analysis, we adjust the amplitude of the mean LOS velocity derived from Envisat data to render the best agreement with the afterslip model corresponding to the time Â­ period of 2007 2009. Figure 10 shows the comparisons between the adjusted Envisat LOS velocities from the Â­ Â­ ascending track T499 (Figures 10a 10c) and the descending track T463 (Figures 10d 10f) to the afterslip model predictions. There is a general agreement in the pattern of surface velocities between the Envisat data and the model, suggesting that the early deformation following the 2005 Kashmir earthquake was also dominated by fault afterslip. At some locations close to the rupture trace, the afterslip model seems to underestimate the surface deformation rate (Figures 10c and 11). While this might be in part due to residual errors in the interferograms (e.g., from atmospheric phase delays), another possibility is that these residuals may signify rapidly decaying fi shallow creep on the earthquake rupture in the rst months and years following the earthquake. Similar behavior was documented by continuous GPS measurements elsewhere [e.g., Burgmann et al ., 2002; Barbot et al ., 2009]. 4. Discussion Rheological properties of the lower crust and upper mantle are of considerable interest, in particular in actively deforming continental settings such as Tibet. Over the past several decades, several end-member models have been proposed to describe the long-term evolution and uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. Some of the proposed fl 16 models appeal to a highly uid layer in the lower crust, with viscosity as low as 10 Pa s, that effectively decouples the upper crust from the underlying mantle [e.g., Royden et al ., 1997; Clark and Royden , 2000]. Such low viscosities are ruled out by studies of postseismic deformation due to large earthquakes in Tibet and adjacent 18 Â­ 19 areas, which suggest much higher viscosities of 10 10 Pa s [e.g., Ryder et al ., 2007, 2011]. In most cases, the published estimates of the effective viscosities are, in fact, lower bounds because of a limited observation period and potential trade-offs between different relaxation mechanisms (i.e., epistemic uncertainties). c(""Our study reveals no obvious contribution of viscoelastic relaxation in the deformation transient following the"", ""2005 Kashmir earthquake. Nevertheless, as the LOS velocities due to viscoelastic relaxation and afterslip"", ""have opposite signs on the hanging wall side of the fault, it is possible that the rapid afterslip could"", ""overshadow the effects of viscoelastic relaxation (if any).

For viscosities above 10 Pa s, because the characteristic relaxation time is greater than the period of observations, the predicted surface deformation is negligible. For the viscosity 19 of 10 Pa s, the predicted rate of surface subsidence (increase in radar range) is ~3 cm/yr during the period of 19 ALOS observations. Therefore, 10 Pa s is a conservative lower bound on the effective viscosity of the lower fi crust of the Western Himalaya region. Future observations may further re ne this bound. In particular, a transition from uplift to subsidence may signal an onset of viscoelastic relaxation in the ductile substrate. Previous studies have suggested that fault slip may induce poroelastic deformation in the host rocks [e.g., Peltzer et al ., 1998; JÃ³nsson et al ., 2003; Fialko , 2004a; LaBonte et al ., 2009]. The inferred timescales of poroelastic rebound are on the order of months to years, depending on the hydraulic diffusivity of the host rocks, as well as on the earthquake rupture size [e.g., Fialko , 2004a; Barbot et al ., 2008; Barbot and Fialko , 2010]. For the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, the poroelastic rebound model predicts a uniform uplift (decrease in radar range) on both sides of fi the fault (Figure 5). The LOS velocities from all three InSAR tracks indicated a signi cant uplift in the hanging wall and only minor (if any) uplift in the footwall (Figures 2 and 3). The latter could be partly due to the low-pass fi ltering applied in the data processing. Alternatively, it may be indicative of poroelastic rebound following the Kashmir earthquake. A strong asymmetry in the LOS velocities across the fault (Figures 2 and 3), as well as a poor fi t between the poroelastic model and GPS observations (Figure 11), suggests that the contribution of poroelastic rebound to the observed surface deformation following the 2005 Kashmir earthquake is minor, compared to that ' of afterslip. It remains to be seen whether poroelastic rebound is a common process in the Earth s crust hosting seismogenic faults [ JÃ³nsson et al ., 2003; Fialko , 2004a; Barbot et al ., 2008; Gonzalez-Ortega et al ., 2014]. Â­ The pattern of surface deformation following the 2005 Kashmir earthquake revealed by the Envisat (2005 2010) Â­ and ALOS (2007 2009) data is most consistent with afterslip on the earthquake rupture, in agreement with previous studies of early postseismic response due to large dip-slip earthquakes [e.g., Hsu et al ., 2002; Yu et al ., 2003; Fialko , 2009; Reddy et al ., 2013; Copley et al ., 2012; Bie et al ., 2013]. At the same time, vertical motion of the ' Earth s surface in the epicentral area of several large dip-slip earthquakes might be indicative of viscoelastic relaxation several tens of years after the earthquakes [e.g., Nishimura and Thatcher , 2003; Gourmelen and Amelung , 2005]. Robust constraints on the effective rheology of the lower crust and upper mantle may require long-term observations that include both the early and late phases of postseismic deformation over a broad range of epicentral distances [e.g., Takeuchi and Fialko , 2013]. Space geodetic observations of the early postseismic deformation due to the 2005 Kashmir earthquake indicate that afterslip mainly occurred downdip of the seismogenic asperity. Spatiotemporal distribution of afterslip inferred from kinematic inversions of data spanning different epochs indicates more robust afterslip on the northern section of the fault compared to the southern section, and faster decay of afterslip on the shallow part of the fault, implying heterogeneities in the rate and state frictional properties on the earthquake rupture."

Conclusions We analyzed the C-band Envisat and L-band ALOS interferometric synthetic aperture radar data from the epicentral area of the 2005 M 7.6 Kashmir (Pakistan) earthquake that occurred on the northwestern edge w of Himalaya. Envisat data are available from both the descending and ascending orbits and span a time Â­ period of ~4.5 years immediately following the earthquake (2005 2010), with nearly monthly acquisitions. Envisat data are highly decorrelated due to rugged topography and precipitation. ALOS data are available from the ascending orbit and span a time period of ~2.5 years between 2007 and 2009, over which they remain reasonably well correlated. The mean line-of-sight postseismic velocity maps in the epicentral area of the Kashmir earthquake are derived using persistent scatterer method for Envisat data and selective stacking for ALOS data. LOS velocities from all data sets indicate an uplift (decrease in radar range), primarily in the hanging wall, of the earthquake rupture (with little uplift in the footwall) over the entire Â­ period of SAR observations (2005 2010). Modeling of viscoelastic relaxation in the lower crust and upper mantle predicts subsidence (increase in radar range) in the epicentral area and provides a lower bound 19 on the effective viscosity of the substrate of ~10 Pa s. Poroelastic rebound model predicts uplift on both sides of the fault. The available data are best explained by afterslip, possibly with minor contribution from poroelastic rebound. Inversions of InSAR and GPS data suggest that maximum afterslip occurred primarily downdip of the area of maximum coseismic slip and that afterslip on the northern half of the fault was more pronounced compared to that on the southern half of the fault."

285 woppel jgrc12296.pdf,I,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Introduction [ ] Tide gauges measure the sea level height with respect 2 to the land upon which the tide gauge benchmarks are grounded. Whereas this observational information may appear as the most adequate and useful quantity for coastal management, to devise any sustainable development plan of the coastline it is desirable to understand what are the causes underlying the observed relative sea level rise and what are the respective magnitudes of these causes. In particular, a major question concerns the relative contributions to sea level rise due to climate change (ocean thermal expansion and/or melting of land-based ice) and due to local land subsidence at the coast. To identify the causes of the changes acting at a particular place on the interdecadal to centennial timescales and to assess their relative importance, monitor- ing the vertical land movement at tide gauges has become an essential and vital aspect of in situ sea level observing sys- tems [ Merrifield et al. , 2010]. [ ] Much research over the past 10 years has focused on 3 vertical land movement determination at tide gauges using the GPS in continuous operating mode [ Blewitt et al. , 2010]. Worthwhile results have been obtained on the global scale, showing reduced dispersion of individual and regional GPS- corrected rates of sea level change [ WÃ¶ppelmann et al. , 2007], provided a global state of the art reanalysis strategy of the GPS observations is applied using the same models, 1 LIENSS, UniversitÃ© de la Rochelle-CNRS, La Rochelle, France. 2 IMEDEA, CSIC-UIB, Esporles, Spain.

However, although considerable efforts are undertaken worldwide to upgrade tide gauge networks with colocated permanent GPS stations, their numbers are still limited [ Merrifield et al. , 2010]. In addition, the geodetic connection between the GPS antenna and the nearby tide gauge benchmark is often missing, which raises the issue of assuming that the vertical land movement sensed by the GPS antenna corresponds to the actual land movement affecting the tide gauge record when the GPS antenna is distant [e.g., Bevis et al. , 2002]. It is worth reminding here that to be useful for long-term sea level applications, site displacements at tide gauges should be determined with greater accuracy than the Ã€ 1 sought-after signal of 1 to 3 mm yr rate of climate-related sea level change over multidecadal to century timescales [ Church et al. , 2010], consequently requiring local stability between the GPS antenna and the tide gauge benchmark at the submillimeter per year level or accurate monitoring through repeated precise leveling surveys. [ ] An alternative approach to accurately estimate vertical 4 land movements was devised by Kuo et al. [2004] from the combination of satellite and in situ sea level data. The advanced approach of Kuo et al. is a refined method adapted from the classical approach of subtracting tide gauge data relative to the coast from geocentric satellite altimetry data [e.g., Cazenave et al. , 1999] that include constraint equa- tions from long tide gauge records. Although the advanced approach showed excellent results of similar performance to state of the art vertical GPS velocities in terms of precision and accuracy [ Kuo et al. , 2004, 2008], it is interesting to note that few studies have implemented the ingenious algo- rithm of Kuo et al. [2004] that takes advantage of the full 1of 14 WÃ–PPELMANN AND MARCOS: SEA LEVEL RISE IN SOUTHERN EUROPE C01007 range of long tide gauge records. As far as our review could reach, the classical approach, which is limited to the satellite altimetry data span, has prevailed in use [e.g., Garcia et al. , 2007; Ray et al. , 2010; Trisirisatayawong et al. , 2011]. Thus, questions arose whether the extension of the advanced approach is valid in different oceanic contexts. For instance, to what extent the underlying assumptions are valid for the method to be applied in the semienclosed sea of the Medi- terranean Sea or in the Atlantic Iberian coast, as a tentative exercise toward open oceanic conditions. [ ] In this study, we base on the Kuo et al. [2004] approach 5 that overcomes the current GPS limitations of data avail- ability at tide gauges to estimate vertical land movements. The approach was applied at tide gauges along the coasts of southern Europe displaying records longer than 40 years and contemporary to satellite altimetry data for at least 8 years. The results permitted to bring out the climate-change-driven sea level rise along these coasts. They demonstrated the performance of the advanced Kuo et al. approach in new geographic and oceanic contexts. It further allowed identi- fying particular areas where subsidence was accurately assessed that could exacerbate the predicted climate-induced sea level rise if they continue at the present estimated rate of change."
285 woppel jgrc12296.pdf,M,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Data Sets 2.1. Satellite Altimetry Data [ ] Gridded monthly global sea level anomalies with a map 6 Ã‚ spacing of 1/4Â° 1/4Â° were obtained from the satellite mul- timission product of the Archiving, Validation, and Interpre- tation of Satellite Oceanographic (AVISO) data server (http:// www.aviso.oceanobs.com, accessed May 2011). This data set was produced by combining data from several satellite altim- etry missions and spans the period from October 1992 to present. All the state-of-the-art geophysical corrections were applied in this data set. In particular, the atmospheric correc- tion using the so-called dynamic atmospheric correction (DAC) was applied too [ Volkov et al. , 2007], combining the standard inverted barometer correction and outputs from MOG2D barotropic model [ CarrÃ¨re and Lyard , 2003], which improves the representation of high-frequency (greater than 1/20 cycles per day) atmospheric forcing as it takes into account both pressure and wind effects. However, in this study the atmospheric correction was added back to the altimetry data set in order to make it comparable to the tide gauge observations. An alternative approach would be to correct the tide gauge observations for the atmospheric effects and compare with the corrected altimetry data. However, no differences would be expected if the corrections applied are consistent (same model). 2.2. In Situ Sea Level Data "" [ ] Time series of monthly averages from the revised 7 "" local reference (RLR) tide gauge data set of the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL; http://www.pol.ac.uk/ psmsl) were used where available along the coasts of the Iberian Peninsula and Mediterranean Sea. The RLR is the most appropriate tide gauge data set for long-term trend sea level studies as its records were previously checked and corrected for local datum continuity over time relative to benchmarks on the vicinity [ Woodworth and Player , 2003]. 2of 14 C01007 This data set was supplemented with the tide gauge record from Alexandria, Egypt, which proved to show a worthwhile time series [ Frihy , 2003] and was kindly provided by Prof. Frihy updated up to 2005. We also extended the PSMSL record of Cascais, Portugal, with 20 years of data (1985 to 2005) kindly provided by Instituto Geografico PortuguÃªs and already quality checked by Marcos and Tsimplis [2008]. [ ] In this study, the focus was set on tide gauges of at 8 least 40 years long time series in order to precisely determine rates of relative sea level change, assuming that the impact of the low-frequency decadal signals was negligible then, and the resulting rates represented the long-term climate contributions plus the uncorrected vertical movement of the land on which the tide gauges are grounded. Tide gauge records longer than 40 years typically display standard errors Ã€ 1 in linear trends of less than 0.5 mm yr [ Douglas , 2001]. This is particularly confirmed in the Mediterranean Sea [e.g., Tsimplis and Spencer , 1997]. Tide gauge records were rejected if they did not contain more than 80% of valid data within the time span of at least 40 years. Tide gauge stations fulfilling these requirements are listed in Table 1. [ ] The tide gauge stations located around the Strait of 9 Gibraltar, namely Cadiz, Algeciras, Tarifa, Malaga and Ceuta, were finally not considered in the analysis. Indeed, Marcos and Tsimplis [2008] reported a large scatter of sea level trends in this region that prevented from identifying a common regional sea level trend. In addition, further analysis and comparisons among nearby shorter records revealed that all these stations display an anomalous behavior in terms of rate of sea level change. For example, when Cadiz is com- pared with nearby Atlantic stations (Huelva and Bonanza), the differences in short-term trends (up to 9 years) are Ã€ 1 between 10 and 20 mm yr . The same applies to Malaga where, in spite of using longer periods, differences show up Ã€ 1 to 8 mm yr . Details about these stations and the quality of their records are given by Marcos and Tsimplis [2008]. [ ] In the Aegean Sea, Khalkis North was also discarded 10 from the analysis because it displayed a poor correlation with neighboring stations (not shown here). Note that this station is located at the Euripus Strait where strong tidal currents have been observed [ Tsimplis , 1997]. In addition, its record has shown a clear change in its variance during the 1970s. Moreover, in the Aegean Sea, Levkas was removed after a close examination of its record in which two large Â­ jumps were found around 1979 1980 and 2003. These two Greek series were considered questionable by Marcos and Tsimplis [2008], together with most tide gauge records in the Aegean Sea. Actually, among our selected records, only Thessaloniki was labeled as a good quality time series in this previous study. The rest showed a large dispersion in trends and correlations that led Marcos and Tsimplis [2008] to sug- gest that repeated problems with long-term benchmark conti- nuity could be affecting the Greek tide gauges. Although caution was advisable based on the above-mentioned results, Katakolon, Alexandroupolis, and Leros data were included in the present study based on our own examination of the updated time series whose individual behavior were apparently correct. [ ] Because of the short overlapping time span with the 11 satellite altimetry period of only 5 years, Genoa was finally removed from the analysis, despite its length and good quality. Indeed, because linear trends of differences between tide gauge records and satellite altimetry data were to be c(""WÃ–PPELMANN AND MARCOS: SEA LEVEL RISE IN SOUTHERN EUROPE"", ""C01007"", ""a"", ""Station was discarded for the reasons explained in the text."", ""computed, we focused on time series with an overlapping"", ""period with altimetry data of at least 8 years (section 4).

Estimation of Vertical Land Movements 3.1. Combining Tide Gauge and Satellite Altimetry Data [ ] The approach implemented here to estimate vertical 13 land movements at tide gauge sites with the highest possible accuracy is based on Kuo et al. [2004] methodology. This approach has been successfully applied to Fennoscandia, the Great Lakes and Alaska [ Kuo et al. , 2004, 2008]. It is an advanced method adapted from the basic classical approach of subtracting tide gauge data relative to the coast from geocen- tric satellite altimetry data [e.g., Cazenave et al. ,1999].

[2004] using the , 2011]. Uncertainties were estimated taking literature using this approach in the Mediterranean Sea [e.g., Garcia et al. , 2007] and the longest data span used here. The poorest error was found corresponding to the shortest altimetry record of 8 years at Venezia. The median error of Ã€ Ã€ 1 1 0.5 mm yr reduced to 0.2 mm yr when moving from the classical to the advanced approach. Most striking was that the vertical land movement estimates were significantly Ã€ 1 modified with differences larger than 3 mm yr . [ ] Consequently, the sensitivity of both approaches was 26 investigated, for instance, by examining the results using the options of altimetry data selection mentioned in the previous section, that is, using the time series of the closest grid point, or the most correlated point, or the average within a 1Â° radius around the tide gauge stations. When the closest grid point of the altimetry data was used instead of the most correlated, the estimates of vertical land movement changed about Ã€ 1 0.22 mm yr on average at the Atlantic stations using Kuo Ã€ 1 et al. [2004] approach, and as little as 0.15 to 0.16 mm yr at the Mediterranean Sea stations. All the differences were s within the 1 formal error bars of the advanced approach. By contrast, in the case of the classical approach, the dif- Ã€ 1 ferences ranged from 0.7 to 0.9 mm yr in both the Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea, that is, consistent but larger than the s 1 error bars. Similarly, when a spatial average of altimetry data within a radius of 1Â° was used, differences were found Ã€ 1 around 0.26 mm yr at the Atlantic stations using the advanced approach. They were as insignificant as 0.08 to Ã€ 1 0.09 mm yr in the Mediterranean Sea, whereas the clas- Ã€ 1 sical approach yielded differences of 0.4 to 0.5 mm yr .In s the latter case, the differences were also within the 1 formal error bars, although 5 times larger than in the advanced Kuo et al. approach. c(""WÃ–PPELMANN AND MARCOS: SEA LEVEL RISE IN SOUTHERN EUROPE"", ""C01007"", ""Estimates of vertical land movements resulting from the advanced"", ""Figure 4."", ""and from the classical approach at (a) Rovinj (Adriatic) and (b) Leros (Aegean) using different durations of"", ""common tide gauge and altimetry data.

They also displayed much larger rate uncertainties. Figure 4 illustrates this typical behavior at Rovinj and Leros sites. Therefore, the require- ment of at least 8 years of overlapping tide gauge and altimetry data was chosen in our study. Discussion [ ] To further assess the performance of the advanced 29 Kuo et al. [2004] method and to appraise to what extent the vertical land movements are responsible for the observed geographic variability in the rates of relative sea level change as observed by the tide gauges along the coasts of southern Europe, we corrected the tide gauge trends for the vertical land movements estimated from the various approaches (Table 3). The uncertainties were obtained by simply propagating the formal errors of each method assuming the variables were random and independent as they resulted from external data or different procedures. [ ] Buble et al. [2010] point out that relative sea level 30 change for the Adriatic has been investigated using a variety of techniques from which no general agreement has arisen, even though it might be expected that the geographic vari- ability in the rate of climate-related sea level change should be negligible in such a relatively small and isolated body of water. Most of the past estimates for Adriatic tide gauge trends were reported by these authors to differ from one Ã€ 1 station to another with a standard deviation of 0.8 mm yr about the mean, which we confirmed to be similar (0.7 mm Ã€ 1 yr ) in our sample of Adriatic stations (Table 3, column 2). It was therefore interesting to note that by correcting these tide gauge trends using the advanced approach (Table 3, column 5), the standard deviation was reduced from 0.7 to Ã€ 1 0.1 mm yr , whereas for the classical approach (column 4) Ã€ 1 the standard deviation slightly increased to 0.8 mm yr . These results were further confirmed in other regions. For instance, the subset of Greek stations had their standard c(""deviation also considerably reduced from 1.2 to 0.1 mm yr"", ""Ã€"", ""1"", ""."", ""By contrast, the classical approach barely modified the agree-"", ""ment showing a standard deviation of around 1.1 mm yr"", ""Ã€"", ""1"", ""."", ""["", ""31"", ""] It is unlikely that independent random variables exhibit"", ""the same mean values to within a precision higher than the"", ""individual standard errors, whereas the method has shown to"", ""allow differences occurring up to around 0.7 mm yr"", ""Ã€"", ""1"", ""within a"",

In this complex context, our estimate may provide some information or at least some constraint on the extent and causes of this phe- nomenon in future work. [ ] It has long been established that Venezia is subsiding 50 as a result of natural long-term compaction of deltaic sedi- ments exacerbated by anthropogenic pumping of water wells between about 1940 and 1975 [e.g., Pirazzoli , 1987; Emery Ã€ 1 and Aubrey , 1991]. Our estimate of around 1.2 mm yr subsidence was found in close agreement with previously published results [e.g., Pirazzoli and Tomasin , 2002; Woodworth , 2003] if one considers these estimates as a cumulative averaged rate of vertical land movement over the past hundred years or so. A relatively wide range of rates could, of course, be derived from short periods of time Â­ including parts of the above-mentioned 1940 1975 period undergoing variable intensity of groundwater withdrawal. [ ] The most enigmatic results of our analysis come from 51 Ã€ 1 the large uplift rate obtained at Leros (1.3 mm yr ). Leros Island is located on the south-east edge of the Aegean vol- canic arc. Few bibliographic references were found on crustal deformation resulting from active tectonic processes at or nearby Leros Island. It was therefore difficult to assess or contrast our estimate of vertical land movement there. On the other hand, such results might help to locate areas of previously unknown uplift. In any event, it is worth men- tioning that evidence for land uplift was found along the northern and western coast of the nearby Nisyros Island from geological proxies [ Stiros et al. , 2005], indicating an almost linear trend during the past 2000 years at a minimum Ã€ 1 rate of 1.7 mm yr comparable to that determined at Leros."
285 woppel jgrc12296.pdf,C,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Conclusions [ ] Little success has been obtained so far to include the 52 nonclimate contribution of vertical land movements from space geodetic techniques in projections of sea level rise relative to the land at the coast [ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , 2007]. Yet this information is crucial in appraising the exposure of populations and assets to future sea level impacts. A rudimentary attempt has recently been made by Hanson et al. [2011], attributing an additional 0.50 m increase in sea level projections for coastal cities lying on deltaic plains. However, the results of our analysis did not support such large rate of subsidence in the case study of Alexandria (Egypt). The advanced approach of Kuo et al. [2004] that we implemented along the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern Iberian Peninsula yiel- ded accurate estimates of vertical land movements at tide gauge sites, thereby supplementing the current limitations of available GPS data at tide gauges. Whereas Alexandria showed a low rate of subsidence, the highest rate was found at Thessaloniki (Greece), which is a heavily industrialized coastal city that is nearly reaching 1 million inhabitants. Vertical land movements can thus represent an important nonclimate contribution to future sea level rise as significant, if not greater, than climate contributions. They need to be known accurately for robust projections of sea level change and subsequent assessment of its actual impact along the coasts. Poor knowledge on land movements may profoundly hamper sea level rise projections, and ultimately lead to expensive mistakes in coastal management policies. 12 of 14 C01007 [ ] The impact of vertical land movements on the spatial 53 variability of observed sea level trends at the coast was also explored along southern European coasts. Highly coherent regional patterns of sea level change were inferred along the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic northern Iberian coasts, once the tide gauge trends were corrected for the vertical land movement estimates from the advanced Kuo et al. [2004] approach. It is unlikely that independent random variables exhibit the same mean values to within a precision higher than the individual standard errors by chance. We interpret the very low probability of achieving close agree- ment by chance between stations lying in different coastline contexts as an indication of the high performance of the advanced Kuo et al. approach to estimate accurate vertical land movements at tide gauges. These findings extend those of Kuo et al. [2004, 2008] in the Fennoscandia, Alaskan coasts, and Great Lakes. A surprising outcome was the sig- nificant high sea level rise along the Atlantic northern Ibe- rian coast, whereas the Mediterranean Sea displayed a rate of sea level change in agreement with previous estimates of Ã€ 1 global sea level rise of around 1.7 mm yr over the past 70 years when correcting the geocentric sea level estimates for the GIA-induced geoid change predicted by SELEN model. Further investigations to identify the forcing factor should be undertaken, beyond the scope of the present study and our first attempts exploring the various climatology data available to us. [ ] Accurate determination of vertical land movements 54 constitutes thus a key step toward identifying the various forcing factors contributing to sea level change at a partic- ular coast, correctly quantifying their relative importance, and improving our understanding of the causes for robust predictions and full assessment of coastal vulnerability by sea level rise. In this line, of particular importance is to increase the number and geographical distribution of the continuous GPS observations at tide gauges. Much remains to be done, however, in spite of the known importance of vertical land movements at the coast. In the meantime, the advanced Kuo et al. [2004] approach represents a worth- while accurate alternative that has proved its superiority to the classical approach of subtracting tide gauge trends from satellite altimetry. It was, however, interesting to note that the quotations of the Kuo et al. study, as far as our review could reach, ignored the novel technique itself, which opti- mally combines short-term altimetry and long-term tide gauge records in a simultaneous adjustment. It is thus hoped that this study will increase the interest for applying this technique in other geographic contexts, either for sea level studies or as a useful source of supplementary data for refining geodynamic studies.

The presence of seismic anisotropy, which is the directional dependence of seismic wave velocity, is required to explain a variety of seismic data. We often distinguish between azimuthal and radial anisotropy (also called Received 14 NOV 2013 polarization anisotropy or transverse isotropy). Azimuthal anisotropy characterizes wave velocity variations Accepted 24 MAR 2014 fi within the horizontal plane. Radial anisotropy quanti es the change in wave velocity between the horizontal Accepted article online 24 MAR 2014 Published online 21 APR 2014 and vertical directions of polarization or propagation. Evidence for radial anisotropy in the uppermost mantle fi rst came from the discrepancy between shear wave velocity models based on Rayleigh or Love wave fi fi dispersion data [ Anderson , 1961]. Azimuthal anisotropy was rst found beneath the Paci c from marine fi refraction experiments [ Hess , 1964]. Many studies have since then con rmed the presence of seismic  anisotropy in the top 250 km of the mantle and in the lowermost mantle (D layer). The mechanism by which seismic anisotropy is generated is usually assumed to be either shape-preferred orientation (SPO) of isotropic structures with contrasting elastic properties such as tubules or lenses, or lattice-preferred orientation (LPO) of the crystallographic axes of elastically anisotropic minerals. In the mantle lithosphere, dislocation creep is likely to be the dominant deformation mechanism due to the "" "" presence of high stress. Lithospheric frozen-in seismic anisotropy is generally attributed to olivine LPO relating to tectonic processes [ Karato , 1989; Nicolas and Christensen , 2013; Silver , 1996] since this mineral has a fi high intrinsic anisotropy and aligns in the ambient stress eld [ IsmaÃ¯l and Mainprice , 1998; Karato , 1989; Nicolas and Christensen , 2013; Zhang and Karato , 1995]. Asthenospheric anisotropy is often thought to be due to olivine LPO associated with the present-day mantle deformation because the fast seismic direction aligns with the absolute plate motion [ Becker et al ., 2003; Debayle et al ., 2005; Debayle and Ricard , 2013; Gung et al ., 2003; Smith et al ., 2004; Yuan and Romanowicz , 2010; Yuan and Beghein , 2013], and the preferred alignment of fl olivine is often used to determine the direction of mantle ow [ Becker et al ., 2003]. A recent experimental study reported, however, crystallographic-preferred orientation (CPO) of iron-free olivine during diffusion creep [ Miyazaki et al ., 2013]. This may alter common views of mantle deformation, but the authors demonstrated that even in the case of diffusion, strong A-type fabric, i.e., with the fast axis almost parallel to Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2013JB010853 fl  the direction of mantle ow, is expected in the asthenosphere. In the D layer, horizontal layering or aligned fi inclusions of a material with contrasting shear wave properties was rst proposed to explain observations of seismic anisotropy [ Kendall and Silver , 1996]. More recent work has, however, shown that LPO of the postperovskite phase offers another possible explanation [ Oganov et al ., 2005].  While the top 250 km of the mantle and the D layer are seismically anisotropic, the presence of seismic anisotropy in the deep upper mantle and bulk of the lower mantle is uncertain. There is also growing evidence for seismic anisotropy at greater depths than previously thought, both in shear wave splitting measurements [ Foley and Long , 2011; Fouch and Fischer , 1996; Wookey et al ., 2002] and in global tomographic models [ Beghein and Trampert , 2004; Beghein et al ., 2006; Ferreira et al ., 2010; Kustowski et al ., 2008; Montagner and Kennett , 1996; Panning and Romanowicz , 2004, 2006; Trampert and van Heijst , 2002; Visser et al ., 2008b; Yuan and Beghein , 2013]. Determining its presence inside and near the mantle transition zone (MTZ) is important to gain insight on the style of mantle convection, which directly relates to the thermochemical evolution of the planet. Existing models of radial anisotropy present large discrepancies, however, and they are unable to robustly constrain whether the vertical or horizontal direction is faster for seismic wave propagation at those depths [ Beghein and Trampert , 2004; Beghein et al ., 2006; Ferreira et al ., 2010; Kustowski et al ., 2008; Montagner and Kennett , 1996; Panning and Romanowicz , 2004, 2006; Visser et al ., 2008b]. Some of the differences between models are due to the inherent nonuniqueness of the inverse problem [ Beghein et al ., 2006; Visser et al ., 2008b], whereas others originate from the chosen prior crustal  model [ Ferreira et al ., 2010], the method employed to calculate crustal corrections [ Leki and Panning , 2010], and prior assumptions regarding the anisotropic parameters [ Beghein and Trampert , 2004; Beghein et al ., 2006]. In addition, the commonly proposed interpretation of radial anisotropy models in terms of LPO has recently been fi challenged [ Wang et al ., 2013] and a combination of LPO and ne layering may have to be invoked at least in the fl upper 250 km of the mantle. This would render the use of radial anisotropy models to constrain mantle ow fi very dif cult. fi Until recently, very few models of azimuthal anisotropy displayed any signi cant signal below 250 km depth. This was mostly due to the limited vertical resolution of the data employed. However, Trampert and van Heijst ' [2002] and Beghein et al . [2008] showed that long period surface wave overtones and Earth s free oscillation data, respectively, are compatible with the presence of azimuthal anisotropy in the MTZ. More recently, we modeled three-dimensional (3-D) global variations in vertically polarized shear wave azimuthal anisotropy from the inversion of Rayleigh wave higher modes [ Yuan and Beghein , 2013]. These data have sensitivity to mantle structure down to about 1400 km depth and enabled us to determine that about 1% SV wave azimuthal anisotropy is present between 300 km to 800 km depth. In addition, we showed that, on average, the fast azimuth of propagation for SV waves changes across the mantle transition zone boundaries where phase changes are believed to occur. Because of the correlation between the location of phase transformations and changes in anisotropy amplitude and fast axes direction, we suggested that the detected MTZ anisotropy is linked to the nature and composition of the MTZ and caused by LPO of wadsleyite and ringwoodite. The goal of the present paper is to extend our previous global study of SV azimuthal anisotropy by adding constraints on horizontally polarized shear wave azimuthal anisotropy. In particular, we aim at determining whether SH anisotropy is present in the deep upper mantle, and whether the changes in anisotropy across the MTZ boundaries found in SV waves [ Yuan and Beghein , 2013] can also be detected for SH anisotropy. We thus inverted anisotropic Love wave fundamental and higher mode phase velocity maps, which are sensitive fi to SH anisotropy down to depths of about 1200 km. While insuf cient mineral physics data are currently available to uniquely interpret models of SV anisotropy in the MTZ in terms of mantle deformation, adding constraints on another elastic parameter will facilitate future interpretation of the results."

Their method also provided consistent phase  300 velocity uncertainties. The lateral resolution of their  400 phase velocity maps generally decreases with  500 increasing overtone number. The authors estimated that fundamental mode models are  600 resolved up to spherical harmonic degree 8 for the   700 2 terms and spherical harmonic degree 9 for the  4 terms. For the higher modes, the lateral  800 Depth (km) resolution was estimated to be of degree 5 and  900   degree 6 for the 2 and 4 maps, respectively. This implies a resolving power of about 4500 km near  1000 the surface, decreasing to ~6500 km near MTZ  1100 depths. This change in resolution with depth is due to a reduction in the quality of the path azimuthal  1200 coverage resulting from a lower number of modes  1300 measured reliably as the overtone number increases [see Visser et al ., 2008a, Figure 2].

Anotherfactorthat affected the resolution of the maps is the choice of the damping made by the authors. Their choice was such that the relative model uncertainty remained constant for all modes, resulting in phase velocity maps of decreasing resolution with increasing overtone number. Because the inferences made in this paper focus on large-scale anisotropy, using data of varying resolution should not strongly affect our results. Another common source of uncertainty when constructing anisotropic phase velocity maps is the existence of trade-offs between the different terms of equation (1), which can result in lateral heterogeneities or topography at discontinuities being mapped into the anisotropy. The resolution matrices calculated by Visser et al . [2008a] showed that there was little mapping of isotropic structure into the anisotropic terms. However, resolution matrices are functions of the regularization and parameterization applied and are not ideal to evaluate the ' parameter trade-offs. In addition, despite the authors best efforts to minimize these trade-offs, one cannot completely separate the different terms because data coverage is imperfect owing to the uneven distribution of earthquakes and seismic stations over the globe. The phase velocity maps employed here consist, nevertheless, of auniquedataset of anisotropichighermodeLovewaves,and keeping the caveats listed above in mind, our study fi should be seen as a rst step toward mapping 3-D SH anisotropy in the mantle. 3.1. Parameterization and Inversion  We modeled 3-D variations in SH anisotropy by inverting the 4 terms ( c and c ) of equation (1) for Love 3 4 wave fundamental and higher modes [ Montagner and Nataf , 1986].

Because the smallest nonzero eigenvalues can also generate instabilities in the inverse problem, care needs to be exercised in choosing the number of eigenvalues that will contribute to the solution. Wiggins [1972]  proposed to construct the inverse operator from the q p largest eigenvalues and corresponding ' eigenvectors. Here we followed Matsu Ura and Hirata [1982] to determine the cutoff number of eigenvalues. Their approach consists in normalizing matrix A by the data covariance matrix C and the prior model d covariance matrix C : m  Ã€ Â¼ 1 A C AC (16) m d  where A is the normalized matrix, and to keep all eigenvalues that are smaller or equal to unity: the sum is   over all 1. We employed the uncertainties estimated by Visser et al . [2008a] for their phase velocity maps i to build the data covariance matrix. With the employed method, the regularization is implicit in the choice of the prior model covariance matrix and modifying C is equivalent to changing the regularization in a least m square inversion [ Snieder and Trampert , 2000] as it yields a different cutoff in the number of eigenvalues. The fl true model resolution matrix R re ects how well the true model, m , was represented by the estimated model, est m , and the trade-offs among the model parameters: Â¼ est true m Rm (17) est true If R = I , then m = m , and the parameters are perfectly resolved. Calculating a resolution matrix can be computationally prohibitive for large inverse problems. Here, however, because we solved equation (8) for E c and E separately at each grid cell, thereby dividing the inverse problem into 2 N small size inverse problems s c (of 18 unknowns each), where N is the number of grid cells, we were able to calculate the resolution matrix c by singular value decomposition.

Generalized Spherical Harmonics, Power Spectrum, and Correlation ' In order to calculate the power spectra of our SH anisotropy model and that of Yuan and Beghein s [2013] SV anisotropy model, we expanded the models in generalized spherical harmonics [ Phinney and Burridge , 1973; Trampert and Woodhouse , 2003] up to degree 20 and calculated the power spectrum for each anisotropic parameter following Becker et al . [2007].

Model Resolution and Robustness We performed several tests, described below, to assess the quality of our SH anisotropy model. First, we tested that our main results, i.e., the presence of about 1% anisotropy in the MTZ and amplitude minimum near the top of the MTZ as described in section 5, are robust with respect to regularization. Second, we examined the vertical resolution of the sensitivity kernels used in this study with a series of synthetic tests. c(""The input models in Figure 3 simulate layering of SH anisotropy of decreasing amplitude with depth.

295 yuan jgrb50622.pdf,RD,Journal of Geophysical Research,"5.1. Average Anisotropy model A 2 In Figures 6a and 6c, we compare the   0.6 model B YB14SHani root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude of  0.5 YB14SHani and YB13SVani, and in Figures 6b and 6d, we display the global  0.4  vertical autocorrelation function of the 2  0.3  and 4 models, respectively. When analyzing azimuthal anisotropy models, it  0.2 is very useful to determine at which depth  0.1 the fast axes for wave propagation fi  0 change direction signi cantly as this can 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 indicate layering in the mantle [ Beghein Trace(R) et al ., 2014; Yuan and Romanowicz , 2010; 2  Yuan and Beghein , 2013]. In Yuan and Figure 5. Averaged reduced for different trace of resolution matrix obtained by changing the prior model covariance (section 3.1). The Beghein [2013] and Beghein et al . [2014], 2  reduced was calculated for a model with anisotropy in the top 410 km we calculated the vertical gradient of the (model A), in the top 670 km (model B) and our SH anisotropy model SV fast axes direction as a function of YB14SHani. The squares mark the regularization chosen for the F-tests. depth to locate where the strongest fi changes in anisotropy occurred. It is, however, more dif cult to quantify changes in fast axes direction with  depth for SH waves because of the 90 Â° periodicity of the 4 terms (equation (1)). Instead, we calculated the   vertical global autocorrelation (equation (32)) for the 4 and 2 models, which we use as a proxy for the vertical gradient of the fast axes. The vertical autocorrelation curves show how the anisotropy at one depth correlates with the anisotropy at another depth. Here we calculated this function using equation (34) and a Ã€ 40 km window (correlation at depth z is the correlation between model at depth z 20 km and model at fl depth z + 20 km), and the model amplitudes were normalized so that the calculated correlation re ects changes in fast axes only and does not account for vertical amplitude changes. Comparison of Figures 6d of this paper and 2b of Yuan and Beghein [2013] shows that the depths at which the vertical autocorrelation is  fi low for the 2 model coincide with depths at which the SV fast axes change direction signi cantly (i.e., where  the vertical gradients are high). We thus took a similar approach for the 4 maps and chose to associate low  autocorrelation values for the 4 model with changes in SH fast axes. We found that RMS amplitude we obtained for G / L and E / N present several peaks in the uppermost mantle Â­ (Figure 6). It is the strongest in the top 200 km with a peak of 1.5 2% for SH at 150 km depth and 2% for SV at 100 km depth, and both models display a smaller peak around 50 km and 250 km depth. The G / L and E / N amplitudes are thus consistent with one another and in agreement with previous estimates of SV anisotropy amplitudes in global and regional models [ Debayle et al ., 2005; Yuan and Romanowicz , 2010], with the exception of the new model of Debayle and Ricard [2013], which displays amplitudes of ~3%. A recent study pointed out a large discrepancy between the amplitude of upper mantle radial anisotropy (which can be as Â­ high as 8% on average) and SV azimuthal anisotropy (typically of the order of 1 2% in the upper 200 km) in tomographic models [ Wang et al ., 2013]. The authors argued that LPO alone cannot explain these differences and that we need to invoke an additional mechanism such as a layered structure to reconcile the two types of fi observations. While our model amplitudes appear to con rm that azimuthal anisotropy amplitudes are much lower than those of radial anisotropy, for both SH and SV waves, caution needs to be taken before interpreting such differences. Anisotropy amplitudes are strongly dependent on the regularization applied during the construction of the phase velocity maps, and regularization tends to lower amplitudes where spatial coverage is sparse or if the noise in the data is high [ Chevrot and Monteiller , 2009]. We also found that the SH and SV anisotropy amplitude minima are associated with changes in fast axes for both SH and SV waves. This can be seen between 50 km and 100 km and at ~230 km depth, which is where the SV fast direction becomes subparallel to the present-day absolute plate motion (APM) as shown by Yuan and Beghein [2013]. Most interestingly, the two parameters display ~1% anisotropy inside the MTZ and an amplitude minimum at the top of the MTZ where the fast axes change direction. Yuan and Beghein [2013] demonstrated that the changes in SV anisotropy between 50 km and 100 km depth and at ~230 km are not c(""due to the chosen parameterization or the presence of discontinuities at 80 km and 220 km depth in the"", ""reference model used to calculate the sensitivity kernels.

As discussed by Yuan and Beghein [2013] for SV anisotropy, the presence of 1% SH and SV azimuthal anisotropy inside the MTZ could be due to the shape-preferred orientation of tilted layers of material with contrasting elastic properties. However, because we also found changes in anisotropy near 410 km depth, where olivine is thought to go through a phase transformation, we suggest that the origin of the observed seismic anisotropy is more likely to be related to the nature of the MTZ. The detected amplitudes in the upper MTZ are consistent with mineral physics estimates for wadsleyite anisotropy [ Kawazoe et al ., 2013; Tommasi et al ., 2004; Zha et al ., 1997], and the changes in fast axes at 410 km depth could simply be due to recrystallization during the phase change from olivine to wadsleyite. The interpretation of these anisotropy fl changes in terms of mantle ow and thermochemical evolution of the Earth is, however, not straightforward owing to the lack of mineral physics data on MTZ material anisotropy. For instance, recrystallization of the olivine structure during phase changes likely erases anisotropy before building up again and therefore could explain the changes in SH and SV anisotropy at 410 km. The presence of water inside or atop the transition zone might also change the anisotropic properties of the olivine structure in the MTZ and how it relates to fl mantle ow direction, as it does at uppermost mantle conditions [ Jung and Karato , 2001]. Further investigations of the effect of water, pressure, or partial melt on the anisotropy of ringwoodite and wadsleyite are therefore needed before one can uniquely interpret our results. 5.2. Global Three-Dimensional Model Figures 7 and 8 display maps between 100 km and 600 km depth for models YB14SHani and YB13SVani, respectively. Large lateral variations in amplitude and fast axes are observed in both models, which might fl suggest a complex mantle ow pattern at depth. Interestingly, regions of high (or low) SV anisotropy do not necessarily coincide with high (or low) SH anisotropy. On the contrary, it even appears that in some areas, the two types of anisotropy are anticorrelated. For instance, most of the high SV anisotropy area at 100 km depth fi fi in northeastern and central Paci c has low SH anisotropy and vice versa for the northwestern Paci c. Similar fi observations can be made at other depths: A high-amplitude dlnE signal can be found in central Paci c in the MTZ, but dlnG is small in that region (dlnG = G / L , where L and G are elastic parameters that determine SV velocities and azimuthal anisotropy, respectively). This apparent anticorrelation between dlnG and dlnE is, nevertheless, not global (Figure S4).  To our knowledge, the only other global inversion of 4 anisotropy published so far is that of Trampert and van Heijst [2002] who used a slightly older higher mode Love wave data set than in the present study. Because their study was focused on the MTZ, we can compare the models only at these depths. While there is general agreement between the models in terms of anisotropy amplitude in the MTZ, we found strong differences in the pattern of SH anisotropy. In both models, strong MTZ anisotropy can be found beneath fi fi Africa and the central Paci c, and low anisotropy near the East Paci c Rise, but the fast axes directions differ substantially. These discrepancies could result from differences in the data sets employed since they used the fi rst and second overtone Love waves only, while the data set we used here [ Visser et al ., 2008a] contained fi Love wave fundamental and higher modes up to the fth overtone. Discrepancies between the models could also arise from the different inversion techniques employed. We performed a classical linear inversion in fi which one typically has to compromise between data t and model size [ Snieder and Trampert , 2000], whereas Trampert and van Heijst [2002] chose a Backus and Gilbert [1968] approach in which the resolution kernel is optimized toward a desired shape and depth range. 5.3. Anisotropy Beneath Oceanic Plates Figure 9 illustrates how SH and SV anisotropy vary beneath oceanic plates. A detailed discussion of YB13SVani under oceanic plates can be found in another paper [ Beghein et al ., 2014]. Here we can compare YB13SVani with our new SH anisotropy model. Interestingly, we detect a change in uppermost mantle dlnE and dlnG fi with plate age only beneath the Paci c Plate (Figures 9d and 9e). In particular, the youngest parts of the fi Paci c Plate present less SH anisotropy in the top 200 km than older regions (Figure 9g), and less SV fi anisotropy than beneath the middle of the plate (Figure 9h). We also nd, as did Nishimura and Forsyth [1989], fi &gt; that uppermost mantle SV anisotropy amplitudes in the Paci c are the lowest for ages 120 Ma (Figure 9h). c(""Remarkably, while SH amplitudes beneath the Paci"", ""fi"", ""c for middle ages are close to the average values for other"", ""oceans (~2%), SV anisotropy is anomalously strong (up to 4%) in the 100"", ""Â­"", ""200 km depth range and for ages"", ""between ~40 Ma to ~120 Ma.

Uppermost mantle relative SH anisotropy amplitude averaged over the Paci c Plate as a function of crustal age. Â¼ C The black solid line represents a half-space cooling model [ Parker and Oldenburg , 1973] assuming T 1350Â° for the m Ã€ Ã€ 6 2 1  mantle temperature, and =10 m s for the thermal diffusivity. On the contrary, SV azimuthal anisotropy in the middle of the plate is anomalously high. A similarly anomalous signal has also been observed in radial anisotropy models [ EkstrÃ¶m and Dziewonski , 1998; Nettles and Dziewonski ,2008; Panning and Romanowicz , 2006], but its origin is not well understood. It appears, however, to coincide with a layer of low shear wave velocities in which the SV fast axes are subparallel to the APM (see Debayle and Ricard [2013] and Figure 9i). This anomalously high radial and SV fl azimuthal anisotropies may result from deformation by dislocation creep in an asthenospheric ow channel as previously suggested [ Gaboret et al ., 2003; Gung et al ., 2003] or from CPO during diffusion creep fi [ Miyazaki et al ., 2013]. Here we show that, interestingly, the Paci c Plate asthenosphere does not display any anomalous SH anisotropy, which may provide additional constraints on the origin of the signal in future research. Â­ No strong age dependence is found for SV anisotropy beneath ~200 250 km depth, but changes in E / N are visible in the MTZ and at ~300 km depth: the anisotropy strength at these depths is greater beneath oceans fi older than ~80 Ma than under younger plates. We veri ed that this is independent of the regularization applied (Figure S5). In addition, we think it is unlikely that these lateral variations result from vertical smearing or parameter trade-offs (see section 4), although a full model space search will be needed in future work to quantitatively assess these possibilities. Interestingly, the map of SH anisotropy at 500 km depth (Figure 7) reveals that this apparent age signal comes fi primarily from the central Paci c and is oriented in the north-south direction. While they are interesting, these variations may not have any physical relation to crustal ages and could illustrate the complexity of the SH fi anisotropy signal at these depths, possibly in relation to the geometry of the convective cells or to the Paci c "" "" superplume. However, we caution and remind the reader of the limited lateral resolution of the data at these depths and the possibility that trade-offs between the isotropic and anisotropic terms of the phase velocity maps may affect the strength of the higher mode anisotropy. 5.4. Anisotropy Beneath Archean Cratons fi Figure 11 focuses on Archean cratons as de ned in model 3SMAC [ Nataf and Ricard , 1996]. Figures 11a and fi 11d display averaged SV and SH amplitude pro les, Figures 10b and 10e show the vertical autocorrelation for SV and SH fast axes, and Figures 10c and 10f represent the angular difference between the APM and the SV fi fast axes. To calculate the vertical autocorrelation in a speci c region, we isolated the targeted area by setting all other regions to zero before performing a generalized spherical harmonics expansion, and amplitudes fl were scaled so that the autocorrelation functions re ect vertical changes in fast axes and not in amplitude. As for the global average shown in section 5.1, we used equation (34) with a 40 km window to calculate vertical autocorrelation curves. Â­ Â­ Figures 11a 11c are for all Archean cratons averaged together and Figures 11d 11f are for the North fi fi American craton, which is suf ciently large for our data to resolve without signi cant contamination from other tectonic regions. As for oceanic plates, the APM was calculated in the no-net rotation reference frame [ Gripp and Gordon , 2002]. In their regional study of the North American craton, Yuan and Romanowicz [2010] showed that their anisotropy fast axis directions were in better agreement with the APM in the hot spot reference frame than in the no-net rotation reference frame. On the contrary, Yuan and Beghein [2013] showed that NNR-NUVEl1 gives the best results for all cratons averaged together. This difference in the c(""results is likely linked to the difference in lateral resolutions of the models, which was higher in the regional"", ""["", ""Yuan and Romanowicz"", "", 2010] study."", ""As explained by"", ""Yuan and Romanowicz"", ""[2010], constraining the depth of the cratonic lithosphere has long"", ""been challenging.

This change in anisotropy fast axes corresponds to a low in the autocorrelation function, equivalent to a high gradient in the fast axes direction, and an amplitude minimum. With this method, we thus estimated an average LAB depth beneath Archean cratons of 250 km (Figures 11a and 11b). A similar value is obtained from the analysis of SV anisotropy ' beneath the North American craton (Figures 11d and 11e). This is consistent with Yuan and Romanowicz s [2010] regional study of the North American craton, and here we show that this is valid on average for all fi cratons. Interestingly, we also nd that the LAB not only corresponds to a change in SV anisotropy but is also associated with a change in SH anisotropy, which displays a minimum in amplitude (Figures 11a and 11d) and in the vertical autocorrelation function (Figures 11b and 11e). fi Several peaks in SH and SV anisotropy amplitudes are visible within this anisotropically de ned lithosphere. For all the cratons averaged together, we detect an amplitude minimum in both types of anisotropy between 50 km and 100 km depth, coinciding with a peak in the vertical autocorrelation functions. Another minimum in amplitude and a peak in the vertical autocorrelation are also found around 140 km for SH waves and fi 180 km depth for SV waves. We also nd changes in SV fast direction around 50 km and 150 km depth beneath the North American craton, but SH anisotropy displays more changes (at ~50 km, 120 km, and 180 km). We tested the robustness of these peaks and troughs in dlnE at a few grid cells beneath continental fi fi regions and beneath the northeastern Paci c (Figure S6). We showed that their position does not signi cantly change with the spline functions spacing, although if the spacing is too wide the model becomes vertically smoother and we lose some of the model features. In addition, we tested that the presence of the peaks does not strongly depend on the crustal model. This was done by comparison of our results with results obtained using the PREM crust instead of CRUST2.0. This includes an example at a grid cell beneath Tibet, which offers fi an end-member case as the Moho depth in that region differs signi cantly from the PREM Moho. Finally, we tested that the presence of discontinuities in the PREM mantle at 80 km and 220 km depth did not affect our results by smoothing the sensitivity kernels at these depths. In their study of North America, Yuan and Romanowicz [2010] revealed a similar change in SV anisotropy within the continental lithosphere, which the authors related to chemical layering under the Archaean crust as evidenced by studies of xenoliths and xenocrysts. They also showed that this intracontinental boundary coincides with the depth of the shallow boundary detected by receiver function and body wave conversion studies. Here we detected multiple changes in SV and SH anisotropy within the cratonic lithosphere. The comparison with the results of Yuan and Romanowicz [2010] is, however, not straightforward, and we do not attempt to explain the observed anisotropy changes in terms of internal boundaries at this stage. Trade-offs in the model parameters in the top 200 km of the mantle (see section 3 for SH anisotropy and Yuan and Beghein [2013] for SV anisotropy) imply that our data may notbeabletoresolve thedifferent peaksinthe autocorrelation function. In addition, we are averaging our models over large regions, and lateral variations in the depth of the intermediate boundary as described by Yuan and Romanowicz [2010] are likely not resolved by our data. More detailed, higher resolution seismological studies of different cratons would be needed to make robust statements regarding the presence of multiple intralithospheric boundaries and to compare changes in SH and SV anisotropy within the cratonic lithosphere. Differences are also visible between the SV and SH models at 300 km depth: A low vertical autocorrelation is found for SH anisotropy but not for SV anisotropy. While this could have important geodynamics consequences, the presence of trade-offs among the SH anisotropy parameters in the uppermost mantle casts doubt on whether this fi difference is signi cant. 5.5. Spectral Analysis We expanded YB13SVani and YB14SHani in generalized spherical harmonics up to degree 20 and calculated their power spectra with equation (33). Figures 12 and S7 show the power spectra for the two models at various depths. Because the generalized spherical harmonic expansion of a second-order tensor starts at degree 2 (see section 3.2 for details), the SV model power spectrum does not have any power at lower degree. Similarly, the SH model power spectrum does not have any energy at degrees lower than 4 because it results from the generalized spherical harmonic expansion of a fourth-order tensor.    We observe a decay of S with l for both the 2 and 4 models at most depths, with a loss of power for l 8. l This is similar to the power spectrum of the SV anisotropy model obtained by Montagner and Tanimoto c(""[1991]. This power loss at high degrees may not, however, re"", ""fl"", ""ect the actual strength of the anisotropy on"", ""Earth and might instead be related to a loss of resolvable power in the data due to the regularization applied"", ""by"", ""Visser et al"", "". [2008a] during the construction of the phase velocity maps. Indeed, as explained in section 2,"", ""the chosen regularization resulted in an estimated resolution of about degree 8 for the fundamental modes"", ""and about degree 6 for the higher modes."", 
""We detect a dominant degree 2 in SV anisotropy between ~100 km and ~200 km depth, and in degree 4 SH"", ""anisotropy between ~100 km and ~150 km depth."", ""Montagner and Tanimoto"", ""[1991] had also observed a"", ""dominant degree 2 SV anisotropy at those depths, in addition to a peak in degree 6.

Conclusions Love wave fundamental and higher mode phase velocity maps were inverted for SH azimuthal anisotropy in the top 800 km of the mantle. We found a general agreement between the average amplitudes of our new SH anisotropy model and the SV azimuthal anisotropy model we previously obtained from Rayleigh wave higher modes [ Yuan and Beghein , 2013], and changes in both SV and SH fast axes generally occur at similar depths. The upper 250 km of the mantle are characterized by average SH and SV anisotropy of ~2%, and we detected ~1% anisotropy for both types of waves in the MTZ. The top of the MTZ is also associated with a change in SV and SH fast axes. Because this is a depth at which the olivine to wadsleyite high-pressure phase change is thought to occur, we inferred that changes in the anisotropic properties of MTZ material are likely at the origin of the observed MTZ signal. The change in fast axes around 410 km depth may result from fl recrystallization during the phase transformation, a change in slip system, or depth changes in mantle ow fl direction, which would indicate strong mantle layering. Interpretation of the model in terms of mantle ow and consequences for the thermochemical evolution of the planet are, however, non unique and further mineral physics and geodynamics studies of the anisotropy of MTZ minerals and the effect of pressure, water, or partial melt are needed. fi Our SV anisotropy model beneath the Paci c and other oceanic plates presents a systematic dependence fi upon crustal age. It is consistent with a thermal origin of the oceanic LAB beneath the Paci c basin, and the fi fl anisotropy of the Paci c asthenosphere is consistent with LPO of olivine due to the present-day mantle ow. fi In contrast, we did not nd any relation between the amplitude or fast axes of our new SH anisotropy model with ocean age. Moreover, our results revealed that while uppermost mantle SV anisotropy is anomalously fi large in the middle of the Paci c Plate, as is radial anisotropy, SH anisotropy has amplitudes close to average fi values for other oceans at this depth. This provides new constraints on the Paci c upper mantle anisotropy signal whose origin has been subject of debate for the past 15 years. Beneath Archean cratons, our results suggest an average LAB depth of ~250 km, consistent with estimates from a regional SV azimuthal anisotropy model of the North American craton [ Yuan and Romanowicz , 2010]. Here we demonstrated that the cratonic LAB is associated not only with changes in SV anisotropy but also with changes in SH anisotropy, thereby providing new constraints on the origin of this interface."

299 zha jgrb50675.pdf,I,Journal of Geophysical Research,"1. Introduction 2014JB011131. Over two thirds of new surface on the Earth is created at oceanic spreading centers. Most of this new material Received 17 MAR 2014 is produced through partial melting of mantle peridotites beneath mid-ocean ridges [ Moores and Vine , 1971; Accepted 29 APR 2014 Sinton and Detrick , 1992], but little is understood about how magma travels through and is emplaced in the Accepted article online 5 MAY 2014 crust. Determining the distribution of melt in the crust is therefore important to understanding the Published online 4 JUN 2014 fi mechanisms of crustal accretion. Seismic studies at the fast spreading East Paci c Rise (EPR) imaged a narrow, Â­ thin magma lens (usually less than 1 km wide and 10 50 m tall) beneath most of the rise axis, at depths ranging from 1.1 to 1.8 km [ Carbotte et al ., 2013; Detrick et al ., 1987; Kent et al ., 1993a; Tolstoy et al ., 1997]. This thin, semicontinuous axial magma lens (AML) sits atop a broader region of low seismic velocity and high attenuation [ Wilcock et al ., 1992]. The AML has been observed to vary along axis from nearly pure melt in some sections to others that may be best described a crystalline mush [ Singh et al ., 1998]. Dikes erupt periodically from the AML to form the overlying extrusive layer, partly draining the AML. Thus, the melt content and thickness of the AML can vary temporally as melt is removed from the lens, added from below, and is cooled from above. While active source seismic studies provide extensive details about the structure of upper crust [ Harding et al ., fi 1993; Toomey et al ., 1994; Vera et al ., 1990], seismic waves encounter signi cant attenuation and diffraction beneath the AML, hindering accurate interpretations of deeper structure. Seismic tomography studies of the EPR show a broader region of lowered seismic velocities (LVZ, for low-velocity zone) beneath the AML [ Vera "" "" et al ., 1990], probably representing a large partially crystalline mush zone, believed to contain large amounts of melt [ Dunn et al ., 2000]. However, the amount of melt in the middle to lower crust and near the Moho transition zone is still largely under debate. A tomographic study by Dunn et al . [2000] suggests that compressional velocities increase rapidly with depth beneath the AML, indicating a decreasing melt fraction fl fl with depth in the lower crust. Other seismic re ection and sea oor compliance studies suggest the presence of a second melt lens at or near the base of the crust [ Crawford et al ., 1999; Garmany , 1989]. Moreover, the fl in uence of melt fraction on seismic velocities depends heavily on the melt geometry [ Hammond and fi Humphreys , 2000; Schmeling , 1985], making it dif cult to calculate the melt fraction from the measurement of c(""one type of seismic velocity, for example, compressional velocities.

However, the sea oor compliance in these previous studies were calculated using a 2-D approximation based on 1-D numerical modeling, which underestimates the effects of rapid lateral variation of physical properties across the ridge axis, and this result needs to be tested using more accurate modeling. In this paper we analyze compliance data collected from Â­ 1994 to 2007 at sites on the EPR 9Â° 10Â°N, using a newly fl developed three-dimensional sea oor compliance modeling technique. By forward modeling the effect of low shear velocity zones on compliance, we seek to provide new constraints on both the across-axis and along-axis distribution of melt in the lower crust. Our results suggest strong variation of lower crustal shear velocities along the ridge axis, with zones of very low shear velocity beneath certain segments. We also analyze repeated compliance  measurements at 9Â°48 N to estimate the temporal change of crustal melt distribution during a period of active Â­ magmatism, especially following the 2005 2006 eruption. We discuss the implications of our results for the mechanism of crustal accretion and melt transport."

Data Collection fl The sea oor compliance data analyzed in this paper were collected at 61 sites during expeditions in 1994, 1999, 2000, and 2007. The spatial coverage of the measurements extends   from 9Â°03 to 10Â°20 along the ridge axis and up to 15 km off axis (Figure 1). In this paper we model crustal velocity structure using compliance data collected along four ridge-     1994 Measurements perpendicular lines: at 9Â°48 N, 9Â°33 N, 9Â°18 N, and 9Â°08 N. 1999 Measurements fl Long-period pressure uctuations from ocean infragravity 2000 Measurements fl waves and the induced sea oor deformation are recorded by 2007 Measurements a differential pressure gauge and broadband seismometer, respectively.

For the ocean depths of the overlapping spreading center (OSC). Locations the EPR measurement sites (2.2 to 2.7 km), the useful fl of 61 sea oor compliance measurement sites from Â­ compliance frequency band is approximately 0.003 0.025 Hz, four expeditions are marked in different symbols (red stars: 1994; blue diamond: 1999; black square: corresponding to ocean infragravity wavelengths from 2 to 2000; and green circle: 2007). 40 km. According to previous compliance modeling studies [ Crawford et al ., 1998, 2005; Hulme et al ., 2005], compliance fl within this frequency range is sensitive to elastic properties at depths from 0 to 10 km below the sea oor. Figure 2 shows the sensitivity of compliance to shear and compressional velocities with depth (dC/d Vs and dC/d Vp , respectively). The dependence of compliance on shear velocity versus depth varies with frequency. In Â­ Â­ general, compliances at 10 18 mHz are sensitive to velocities in the upper and middle crust (0 3km deep), and &lt; Â­ compliances 10 mHz are more sensitive to the lower crust and uppermost mantle (3 10 km deep). The dependence of compliance on compressional velocity variation is concentrated in the upper crust (Figure 2b); thus, variations in upper crust velocities have similar effects on compliance at all frequencies. Therefore, compliance is a good tool to study the shear velocity structure of the oceanic crust and uppermost mantle. During analysis of the 2007 data, we discovered that the transfer function used for the differential pressure Â­ gauges in the earlier compliance measurements (1994 2000) was incorrect.

Horizontal black lines in each plot mark the Moho depth. appears to have been an error in the in situ calibrator used for the pressure measurements in the earlier measurements. Unfortunately, the compliance meters used during these earlier measurements were fi dismantled, so we are unable to con rm the source of the problem. However, we were able to use records of Rayleigh waves recorded at the seabed during these measurements to determine the transfer function between the pressure sensor and seismometer and so correct the older compliance data. The maximum errors for the corrected data are less than 10%. The correction in the calibration reduces the amplitude, but not the shape of the anomalies previously discussed by Crawford and Webb [2002] and Crawford et al . [1999], implying the same subsurface features but with slightly different amplitude. We will show that 3-D effects have a stronger effect on the inferred shear velocities than the corrected calibration. The earliest compliance data described by Crawford et al . [1991] and Crawford et al . [1998] used a laboratory calibration of the pressure gauges, and those data appear to be correct. The compliance data shown in this paper are also corrected for the effect of the gravitational attraction of the changing mass in the waves overhead of the sensor using equation (6) of Crawford et al . [1998] (but removing  an errant factor of 2 in the exponential in the equation). Ã€ kH a Â¼  G  e h 2 (2) W W W Ã€ Ã€ 11 2 3 where a is the gravitational attraction of water, G = 6.6732 Ã— 10 Nm kg is the gravitational constant, W  3 = 1040 kg/m is the density of seawater, H is the water depth, and h is the sea surface displacement. W W The apparent acceleration observed by the seismometer is the sum of the deformation under wave loading and the gravitational attraction of the waves, which is of opposite sign. After removing the gravitational attraction from the data, the actual compliance is slightly higher than apparent compliance below 5 mHz. ' fl The change in the Earth s gravitational attraction due to the displacement of the sea oor to and from the fl center of the Earth under wave loading also produces an apparent change in sea oor compliance, but this second gravitational term is negligible above 1 mHz. 3.1. Numerical Modeling Previous studies [ Crawford and Webb , 2002; Crawford et al ., 1991, 1999] have calculated theoretical fi compliance functions using 1-D propagator matrix and 2-D nite difference methods. In block inversions for fi shear velocity structures the compliance from a 2-D model was calculated by spatial ltering the 1-D fi modeling results [ Crawford et al ., 1998]. This approximation signi cantly underestimates the effects of lateral variation and thus biases the calculated compliance toward that of a 1-D layered structure [ Iassonov and Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011131 Crawford , 2008]. This leads to inferring a smaller and weaker low velocity anomaly beneath the ridge axis. These models also do not account for the orientation of the forcing waves with respect to the ridge. Because crustal low-velocity zones are more continuous along the ridge axis direction, along-axis propagating ocean waves will sense a different dimension of these velocity anomalies. fl In this paper we use a newly developed 3-D elastic sea oor compliance modeling technique based on fi nite element code Pylith [ Aagaard et al ., 2008; Williams , 2006; Williams et al ., 2005] to more accurately calculate the compliance signal expected for a given subsurface velocity model. The velocity structure Â­ beneath the EPR 9Â° 10Â°N is relatively continuous along axis over scales of tens of kilometers, both in the uppermost mantle and beneath the AML [ Dunn et al ., 2000]. Therefore, in order to reduce the number of model parameters required, we use 2-D velocity models that are invariant and continuous along the ridge axis throughout this paper and vary the 2-D model for each cross-axis lines. We simulate ocean infragravity fl waves by applying sinusoidal pressure uctuations of varying wavelengths on the top boundary of the fl fi model (the sea oor). The direction of wave propagation can be speci ed arbitrarily, from ridge parallel to ridge perpendicular. We show in section 4 that ocean waves propagating in a ridge-parallel direction are more sensitive to crustal low-velocity zones than waves in a ridge-perpendicular direction, leading to higher compliances. Throughout this paper, we use the conservative assumption that ocean waves propagate parallel to the ridge, if not explicitly stated otherwise. This assumption will bias the model toward slightly higher velocities (or smaller anomalies). 3.2. Model Formation Compliance depends most strongly on shear velocities but also depends on compressional velocities and density [ Crawford et al ., 1991]. We construct a starting model based on a reference 2-D compressional velocity  model from seismic refraction studies at the EPR 9Â°30 Nby Dunn et al . [2000]. This model contains a midcrustal fl LVZ beneath the ridge axis. The velocity in the LVZ is lowest at approximately 1.5 km below sea oor and Â­ increases with depth. The LVZ is slightly asymmetric, with the lowest velocity located 0.5 1km west of the ridge. fi The width of the LVZ is about 8 km. We use the symmetric component of this 2-D pro le for the starting Vp model. We also adjust the crustal thickness from 7 km to 6 km to match recent seismic constraints [ Canales et al ., 2003]. A 1 km wide, 30 m thick axial magma lens (AML) is included in the starting model. To convert the starting model of compressional velocity to shear velocity, we use four different Vs-Vp relationships depending on the expected petrology and morphology at a location. Near the spreading ridge many factors contribute to the Vs-Vp relationship, including high temperature, the existence of partial melt, and porosity and fracturing in the shallow crust. Thus, it is unrealistic to use a uniform relationship for the entire model. We instead divide the model into subregions and apply different Vs-Vp relationship to each subregion: (1) For the off-axis crust and mantle, as well as on-axis upper crust, we use a constant Vs / Vp ratio of Â­ 0.54, following Vera et al . [1990]. (2) The uppermost 100 200 m of the seismic layer 2A has been shown to &lt; have very low Vs / Vp ratio ( = 0.43), due to extensive fractures and high porosity [ Vera et al ., 1990]. We use fi Vs / Vp = 0.43 for the top 100 m of our models. (3) We de ne the axial accretion zone as 1.2 to 9 km below the fl sea oor and within 4 km of the ridge axis. In this region the Vs-Vp relationship is largely controlled by temperature and the presence and geometry of partial melt. Rock mechanics experiments show that   incremental changes in Vs and Vp can be related as d ln Vs /d ln Vp = [ Takei , 2002], where range from 1.0 to 2.3  depending on the melt geometry. In the starting model we use = 1.5, which corresponds to the upper bound of textually equilibrated partially molten rocks [ Takei , 2002]. This model gives a lowest Vs of ~2.0 km/s near the  fi  AML. In section 4 we use the compliance data from 9Â°33 N to determine the best tting values of .Then we use  fi this same value of throughout the axial accretion zone to t the complete compliance data set. This "" "" relationship requires a starting melt-free value of Vp and Vs .We use Vp = 7.2 km/s, Vs = 3.9 km/s for the crust, and Vp = 8.2 km/s, Vs = 4.4 km/s for the mantle. The starting shear velocity model is shown in Figure 3. The Vs-Vp relationship of partially molten rock also depends on the frequency of the wave, due to anelastic effects [ Kampfmann and Berckhemer , 1985; McCarthy and Takei , 2011]. We expect Vs at compliance Â­ frequencies (0.005 0.02 Hz) to be lower than Vs at seismic frequencies (~5 Hz). However, the amplitude of this difference is highly uncertain, and simultaneously interpreting compliance due to elastic and anelastic effects in a viscoelastic media is beyond the scope of this paper. We therefore incorporate the effects of anelastic  dispersion into the parameter of the shear velocity model and do not independently consider the frequency dependence of Vs-Vp relationship within the compliance frequency band.

Results In previous 1-D modeling studies, the higher-frequency compliance peak observed near 14 mHz at sites on the ridge axis was considered to be the effect of a molten axial magma lens (AML) with near-zero shear fi velocity [ Crawford et al ., 1991]. However, the 1-D approximation signi cantly underestimates the effect of Â­ fl lateral variations in structure. At 9Â° 10Â°N on the EPR the AML imaged by seismic re ection typically ranges  from 500 to 1000 m wide, with exceptions near the 9Â°03 overlapping spreading centers (OSC) [ Kent et al ., 1993b]. In order to quantify the effects of a realistic melt lens, we calculated compliance variation due to AMLs of different widths, thicknesses, and shear velocities. Compliance are calculated from the starting Vs  model constructed using = 2.0, with an AML at 1.5 km depth. Figure 4 shows that compliance is quite insensitive to shear velocities in a 100 m tall, 1 km wide melt lens. Furthermore, only when the width of the lens exceeds 2 km does its low shear velocity appreciably affect the compliance signals. Therefore, the narrow &lt;  AML ( = 1 km) observed at 9Â°50 N on the EPR is likely too narrow to be resolved by compliance observations. This is consistent with the previous 2-D modeling study of Iassonov and Crawford [2008]. Based on this sensitivity study, we conclude that the along-ridge variation of compliance observed at the EPR is mostly due to variations in the shear velocities within the LVZ beneath the AML, rather than with the velocity and thickness of the AML. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011131 a) In modeling a molten magma lens, instead of setting 0.05 Vs = 0, we use a very small velocity Vs = 0.01 km/s for computational stability.

Changing Vs in the Â­ fl LVZ (1.5 4 km below sea oor) mostly affects compliances at frequencies above 10 mHz (Figure 2). Therefore, fi we calculate the mis t of each model both (1) over all frequencies and (2) over the higher-frequency band Â­   (11 18 mHz) (Table 1), and we choose the that minimizes both. Assuming a constant Vs / Vp ratio ( =1) or the  fi commonly assumed = 1.5 signi cantly underestimates on-axis compliances, especially between 11 and 18 mHz  Â¼ : 2 ( 74 6 and 23.9, respectively). The compliance in this frequency range requires a lower shear velocity on axis Â­ fl   within the LVZ (1.5 4 km below sea oor) and therefore a higher value of . A model with = 2.0 has the fi  2 Â­  lowest total mis t over all frequencies ( = 3.2). In the high-frequency band (11 18 mHz), models with = 1.8  fi  2   2  fi and = 2.0 both have low total mis t( = 2.2 for = 1.8 and = 2.6 for = 2.0), but the on-axis mis t for the   2 fi   2  =1.8 model ( =6.6) is signi cantly higher than that of the = 2.0 model ( = 3.2). Therefore, we use =2.0 to relate Vp and Vs throughout this paper. This model indicates a lowest LVZ shear velocity of approximately 1.5 km/s beneath the AML. Four different Vs-Vp relationships used in the modeling are illustrated in Figure 6c. For the same reduction in Vp , Vs reduction will be larger for partially molten crust and mantle (red and green curves, respectively) than for normal, melt-free crust and mantle (blue straight line). We note here again that Â­ this relationship was obtained using frequencies 2 3 orders of magnitude lower than active source seismic frequencies. Due to anelastic dispersion effects, the shear velocities at active source seismic frequencies near 5 Hz should be slightly higher than those indicated by compliance measurements. fi We note that although the starting Vp model and a proper Vs-Vp relationship t high-frequency compliance  2 &lt; data reasonably well ( 3), these models all underestimate compliance below 10 mHz, which are mostly controlled by lower crustal velocities.

No melt bodies of similar or larger scale have fl been reported by seismic re ection studies. Therefore, we conclude that the observed compliance anomaly cannot be solely explained by a single Moho-level melt lens. fi Although the geometry of the DLZ is an over simpli cation, this model provides an estimate of the average Â­ Â­ effective shear modulus over a 2 5 km thick region at compliance frequencies (5 20 mHz). The shear velocity Â­ in the DLZ is approximately 30% 60% lower than the velocity inferred from the starting model, which increases from 3 km/s at 4 km depth to 4 km/s at 7 km depth using the relationship between Vp and Vs described above. The deep DLZ and the shallow LVZ (Figure 8) do not need to be separated by a high-velocity region. We inserted a discrete DLZ into the starting model in order to minimize the number of model fi parameters, but a model with smooth shear velocity transition from the LVZ to the DLZ may t the compliance data as well. The calculation of 2-D smoothed models from the compliance data will be the subject of future studies. &gt; In the higher-frequency range ( 11 mHz), compliance measurements at various frequencies are asymmetric with respect to the ridge. Compliance measured from 3 to 7 km east of the ridge are lower than compliance measured at similar distances to the west, suggesting a higher upper crustal velocity to the east of the ridge. This asymmetry can be accounted for by increasing the shear velocity in the upper 100 m by 0.8 km/s at distances from 3 to 7 km east of the ridge. This is likely a result of thinner layer 2A. Our estimates of shear velocity are based on the assumption that the forcing ocean wave propagates along axis and that the DLZ is continuous along the axis. As discussed in section 4.1, this assumption gives a conservative estimate of the shear velocity anomaly in the LVZ and DLZ, if they are relatively continuous along axis. The LVZ beneath this well-studied section of EPR has been shown to be relatively continuous both in the uppermost mantle and beneath the AML over tens of kilometers [ Dunn et al ., 2000], suggesting that a fi continuous LVZ is a reasonable simpli cation.  N From 4.4. Temporal Changes of Compliance Measurements and Inferred Structures Near 9Â°48 1994 to 2007 Â­  fl During 2005 2006, the EPR near 9Â°48 N erupted a thick layer of lava onto the sea oor along 18 km of the rise  axis [ Soule et al ., 2007]. On-axis compliance measurements at 9Â°48 N in 2007 experiment showed a decrease in compliance at nearly all measured frequencies compared to the previous measurements (1994 and 1999), with the largest decrease between 7 and 14 mHz (Figure 9a). Compared to the large decrease of compliance from 1999 to 2007, differences between the 1994 and 1999 on-axis measurements are nearly negligible, except for a small decrease near 8 mHz. This result indicates an increase in crustal shear velocities between 1999 and 2007. An increase of shear velocity could occur in the AML, LVZ, or the DLZ. But our sensitivity study fi earlier this section showed that changes of shear velocity in the AML are not likely to signi cantly affect the compliance signal (Figure 4). Even if Vs in a 100 m tall, 1 km wide AML increases from 0.01 km/s to 1.5 km/s, the change of compliance is only 2% at 14 mHz, much less than the observed 20% decrease in the data. We modeled the observed decrease of on-axis compliance as simply as possible by changing the shear velocities fi in the LVZ and DLZ. We searched for the models that best t the posteruption compliance data using the same procedure as described in section 2 while keeping the same upper crustal velocity model. The best fi tting posteruption model includes higher velocities in both the LVZ and DLZ (Figure 9). In the LVZ, shear velocities increase by up to 0.6 km/s (the minimum shear velocity increases from 1.5 km/s to 2.1 km/s). The fi  2 presence of a DLZ is still preferred, giving a slightly lower overall mis t( = 2.50) than a model without the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011131 (a) (b) Comparison of compliance measurements On-axis Vs models 0.05 0 1994 data 1999 data -1 2007 data 0.045 -2 0.04 -3 -4 0.035 -5 0.03 -6 Depth / km -7 0.025 Compliance (1/GPa) -8 0.02 1999 model -9 2007 model - along-axis wave  2007 model - cross-axis wave 0.015 -10 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0 1 2 3 4 Frequency (Hz) Shear velocity / (km/s)  Figure 9.

(b) Comparison of on-axis velocity pro les corresponding to 1999 and 2007 data. Geometry of DLZ is same as illustrated in Figure 8.  2 DLZ ( = 2.96), but compliance in 2007 is much more sensitive to the LVZ than to the DLZ (Figure S2), so we Â­ cannot determine if there is a change in DLZ velocities after the 2005 2006 eruption. In section 4.1 we showed that the direction of the forcing infragravity waves can also affect compliance. A small part of the observed changes in on-axis compliance from 1999 to 2007 could be caused by changes in the wave direction, but even the most extreme change in wave direction (from purely ridge parallel in 1999 Â­ to purely ridge perpendicular in 2007) would only decrease compliance by 3 5%, much less than the fi observed ~20% change in compliance (Figure 9a). Furthermore, we have obtained alternate best t models for 2007 data assuming either ridge-parallel or ridge-perpendicular wave directions (Figure 9b). The difference between these two models is also much smaller than their differences with the preeruption model. Therefore, we conclude that the observed decrease in on-axis compliances can be mainly attributed to the increase of shear velocities within the axial LVZ. 4.5. Along-Axis Variation of Lower Crustal Velocity Structure To study the along-axis variation of the melt distribution, we analyzed compliance data from three other    ridge-perpendicular lines, crossing the rise axis at 9Â°33 N, 9Â°18 N, and 9Â°08 N. The latter line is at the northern  fi end of an overlapping spreading center (OSC) near 9Â°03 N. We search for the best tting models for these lines, following the procedure discussed previously. Because the upper crust structure is different for each fi fi line, we rst determine appropriate layer 2A velocities and thicknesses by tting only the higher-frequency fi compliance data then add lower-frequency data to determine best tting velocities for the LVZ and DLZ. The fi DLZ is not added unless it is required to t the data. Figure 10 shows on-axis compliance measurements compared to forward calculations (top row), the cross-axis compliance at 10 mHz (middle row), and the  preferred models (bottom row). To facilitate comparison, the compliance data at 9Â°48 N are shown as grey circles in the top two row.  N 4.5.1. Compliance at 9Â°33   Compliances at 9Â°33 N are quite similar to those at 9Â°48 N both in terms of frequency dependence and cross- axis shape (Figure 10a). Compliance at 10 mHz is higher 0.5 km west of the rise axis than at the rise axis   [ Crawford and Webb , 2002]. The preferred velocity structure at 9Â°33 N is also similar to that at 9Â°48 N, with a 5 km wide LVZ and a DLZ. The lowest shear velocity in the LVZ is approximately 1.5 km/s, but the center of the LVZ is offset 0.6 km to the west of the ridge crest. This misalignment agrees with previous seismic Â­ tomographic model with the lowest Vp located 0.5 1 km west of the ridge [ Dunn et al ., 2000]. In the lower fi crust, a DLZ is also preferred by the on-axis compliance data. The best tting model has a 4 km wide, 3 km tall fi  2 DLZ, with Vs = 2.0 km/s ( Vp = 5.2 km/s).

We will discuss the implication of this along-axis variation of DLZ in section 5.  N 4.5.2. Compliance at 9Â°18  Compliance at 9Â°18 N is characterized by a strong asymmetry across the rise axis, especially at high &gt;    frequencies ( 0.01 Hz). The on-axis compliances at 9Â°18 N are lower than those at 9Â°48 N and 9Â°33 N at all frequencies, and compliance is higher 3.4 km west of the rise axis than on axis (Figure 10b). The differences between these two sites (on axis and 3.4 km west) are greatest at the higher frequencies, suggesting that most of the anomalous high compliance west of the axis is caused by a slower upper crust. Previous fl  multichannel seismic re ection studies revealed a large AML up to 4.15 km wide near 9Â°17 N[ Kent et al ., 1993a] and a thicker than normal extrusive layer 2A to the west of the wide AML [ Harding et al ., 1993]. We suggest that the higher-compliance anomaly to the west of the ridge crest is a result of both the westward  shift of the AML/LVZ with respect to the ridge and a thicker 2A layer. In modeling the 9Â°18 N data, we use an AML 4 km wide and centered 1 km west of the axis. Due to the complex asymmetry in the data, we did fi fi not try to t compliance functions at all the sites. We instead t only the two measurements closest to the fi ridge crest in order to obtain a rst-order estimate of the amplitude of the crustal shear velocity anomaly.  In our preferred model for 9Â°18 N (Figure 10b), the upper 100 m of layer 2A west of the axis is slower than normal, with a shear velocity of 1.0 km/s compared to 1.4 km/s on the eastern side. In the midcrust, the center of the LVZ is located 2 km to the west of the axis. Despite a very wide AML imaged, the velocity anomaly in the   LVZ is smaller than that of 9Â°48 N and 9Â°33 N, with a relative amplitude of 0.8 and minimum Vs of 1.8 km/s.   Unlike 9Â°33 N and 9Â°48 N, a DLZ in the lower crust is not required by the data. This does not exclude the possibility of a smaller DLZ or one with higher velocities. Because of the decaying resolution of compliance with depth, a small DLZ near the base of the crust with lateral dimensions less than 1 km can neither be ruled out nor required in the models. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011131  N 4.5.3. Compliance at 9Â°08   The 9Â°08 N measurement line crosses the ridge axis at the eastern limb of the 9Â°03 N overlapping spreading center (OSC). The eastern limb propagates southward and is currently replacing the western limb as the main axis of spreading [ Macdonald et al ., 1988]. In this area the upper crust melt lens beneath the eastern limb was Â­ also imaged to be 3 4 km wide [ Kent et al ., 2000]. Compliance measurements exhibit a broad, asymmetric Â­ peak at 8 14 mHz: compliance at 10 mHz is highest at the eastern limb axis, rapidly decreasing to the east (Figure 10c) but slowly decreasing to the west, toward the northern tip of the western axis. West of the western axis, compliance again drops off rapidly [ Crawford and Webb , 2002]. High compliances between the east and west limb axis suggest that both the eastern and western limb fl  in uence this LVZ even though the line is north of the overlap basin. Similar to 9Â°18 N, compliance data near  fi 9Â°08 N are highly asymmetric and cannot be t by a symmetric model. We vary the width, amplitude of fi velocity anomaly of the LVZ, and its lateral position relative to the ridge axis in order to nd a model that fi minimizes compliance mis ts for the eastern and western axis only. fi  The best t LVZ at 9Â°08 N is about 13 km wide, more than twice as wide as LVZs at all other locations. The lowest velocity in the LVZ is approximately 1.65 km/s and lies between the eastern limb and western limb of the OSC, closer to the eastern limb axis (offset ~1.5 km) (Figure 10c). This is consistent with seismic tomography studies that place the strongest velocity anomaly west of the eastern limb axis [ Bazin et al ., 2003;  Tong et al ., 2003]. Although an anomalously wide LVZ and AML are suggested beneath the 9Â°08 N line, a DLZ fi  2 fi is not required by compliance data. This model yield an on-axis mis tof = 0.92, but the overall mis t is still  2   high ( = 5.71). The greater complexity of crustal structure at 9Â°18 N and 9Â°08 N suggests that a full 2-D fi compliance inversion technique without prior assumptions of discrete blocks is needed to resolve the ner- scale structure. The development of such inversion scheme will be investigated in future studies. 5.1. The DLZ: Implication for Crustal Melt Distribution Â­ Our compliance analysis improves constraints on crustal shear velocities within the EPR 9Â° 10Â°N segment.   Compliance modeling suggests that a DLZ is present in the axial lower crust at 9Â°48 N and 9Â°33 N section of fi  the EPR. The best tting DLZ velocity is Vs = 1.5 km/s ( Vp = 4.5 km/s) at 9Â°48 N and Vs = 2.0 km/s ( Vp = 5.2 km/s)  Â­ fl at 9Â°33 N. The DLZs are located at 4 7 km below the sea oor, beneath the bulk of the seismically imaged low- velocity zone [ Dunn et al ., 2000; Vera et al ., 1990]. Our modeling suggests that the lateral extent of the DLZ is limited to within 4 km from the ridge axis. The large velocity anomaly of the DLZ indicates the presence of elevated temperature and partial melt in the Â­ axial lower crust. Assuming a reference compressional velocity of 7.2 km/s for off-axis lower crust at 4 6 depth  [ Dunn et al ., 2000; Vera et al ., 1990], Vp of 4.5 km/s in the DLZ at 9Â°48 N corresponds to a 37% velocity Ã€ Ã€ Ã€ 5 1 reduction. In calculating the temperature effects on Vp , we use d ln Vp /d T = 14 Ã— 10 K , derived by Dunn et al . [2000] based on Christensen [1979] and Karato [1993] which takes into account anelastic effects. Assuming a reference off-axis temperature of 300Â°C at 4 km depth [ Henstock et al ., 1993] and a maximum temperature of 1195Â°C for the liquidus [ Sinton and Detrick , 1992], only 34% of the total Vp anomaly Ã€ Ã€   ( 0.89 km/s out of 2.7 km/s) in the 9Â°48 N DLZ (and 44% of the 9Â°33 N anomaly) can be explained by elevated temperatures alone. The remaining velocity anomaly in the DLZ requires the presence of partial melt. Melt can exist in isolated fi pockets or in connected lms and cracks. The geometry of the melt greatly affects the velocity reduction [ Faul et al ., 1994]. Melt in isolated spheres and ellipsoids produces much smaller velocity reduction than does melt fi in organized lms at relaxed state [ Hammond and Humphreys , 2000; Schmeling , 1985]. Different melt geometries also produce different relative fractional decreases of Vs and Vp (d ln Vs /d ln Vp ). Melt in cracks fi and lms generally yield a higher d ln Vs /d ln Vp value than melt in textually equilibrated partially molten rocks [ Takei , 2002]. Therefore, by combining Vs constraints from compliance with Vp constraints from prior seismic tomography studies, we can better constrain the amount and geometry of melt than can either Â­  method alone. In the axial lower crust (4 6 km) at 9Â°33 N, the Vs anomaly determined by compliance Â­ Â­ (48% 50%) and the Vp anomaly from seismic tomography (11% 25%) [ Dunn et al ., 2000] yield Ã€ dln Vs /d ln Vp = 1.9 4.5, which exceeds the predicted limit of d ln Vs /d ln Vp = 1.5 for textually equilibrated Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011131 partially molten rocks [ Takei , 2002]. This indicates that melt in the DLZ may be predominantly stored in low fi aspect ratio lms or cracks instead of isolated ellipsoidal pockets. We use the results of Hammond and Humphreys [2000] to calculate the melt fraction in the DLZ from Vs  Â­ anomalies. In the lower crust at 4 km depth, melt fraction in the DLZ at 9Â°48 N ranges from 11% 22% for Â­ fi  Â­ isolated ellipsoids to 6 9% for lm geometry. At 9Â°33 N, the inferred melt fractions are slightly lower: 7 14% Â­ fi Â­ for ellipsoids and 4 6% for lms. This range of melt fractions (4% 14%) is roughly consistent with the Â­  estimates (5% 22%) from seismic tomography study at EPR 9Â°30 N[ Dunn et al ., 2000]. Near the base of the Â­  crust at 6 km depth, compliance modeling also suggests a large melt fraction: 7% 24% at 9Â°48 N and Â­  Â­ 5% 17% at 9Â°33 N. At this depth melt fraction estimated by compliance is larger than the estimate (2% 11%) by seismic tomography [ Dunn et al ., 2000]. fi Melts in the DLZ are likely stored in low aspect ratio bodies such as lms, cracks, or sills. The elastic effects of fi connected sills and lms should be equivalent if their dimensions are both smaller than the forcing wavelength [ Hudson , 1981]. The depth of the DLZ approximately corresponds to the lower gabbroic section and the Moho transition zone at the Oman ophiolite [ Kelemen et al ., 1997]. Geochemical analysis of this section indicates that lower layered gabbros may be the remaining solid from which melt was extracted to form the upper crustal dikesand lavas[ Kelemen et al ., 1997; Korenaga and Kelemen , 1997]. It has been suggested that the lower crust at fast spreading ridges consists of multiple meter-scale magma sills, in which some portion of melt crystallizes fl in situ [ Kelemen et al ., 1997; Korenaga and Kelemen , 1997]. Several seismic re ection studies have imaged off-axis melt lenses near the Moho [ Canales et al ., 2009; Nedimovic et al ., 2005] and in the midcrust [ Canales et al ., 2012]. Although we did not directly model the compliance of meter-scale molten sills, a previous 2-D modeling study by Iassonov and Crawford [2008] has shown that multiple low aspect ratio molten sills ( Vs ~0) imbedded in a high-velocity lower crust can produce the same compliance anomaly as a region with constant low velocity. A series of thin, horizontal melt sills could also increase Vp / Vs ratio to up to 3.5 and produce strong fi transverse anisotropy [ Wang et al ., 2012], which can lead to signi cant Vs reduction but only moderate Vp reduction due to the different sensitivity of body wave refraction tomography and compliance [ Hulme et al ., 2003]. Therefore, the DLZ suggested by compliance modeling, along with the Vp imaged from seismic   tomography, is consistent with the existence of aligned melt sills in the lower crust beneath 9Â°48 Nand 9Â°33 N. In addition to low aspect ratio melt geometry, anelastic effects may also contribute to the large ratio of Vs and  Vp anomalies suggested by compliance and seismic tomography near 9Â°33 N, because the compliance observations are made at much lower frequency than active seismic wave tomography. The axial lower crust Â­ at EPR 9Â° 10Â°N has been shown to have strong attenuation [ Wilcock et al ., 1992]. The apparent velocity of attenuating partially molten rocks may be more strongly frequency dependent than that of melt-free rocks [ Aki and Richards , 2002; McCarthy et al ., 2011]. Therefore, the shear velocities at compliance frequencies (~0.01 Hz) may be lower than at the frequency of active seismic tomography (~5 Hz). We did not include this anelastic dispersion effect in building our shear velocity model, as an anelastic correction would require knowing the amplitude and frequency dependence of Q for rocks with partial melt, an area of much current uncertainty. The inferred melt fractions should be slightly smaller once this effect is properly accounted for. 5.2. Midcrustal LVZ Â­   Compliance modeling suggests that in the axial midcrust (1.5 4km deep), the LVZs at 9Â°48 Nand 9Â°33 Nare Â­ 5 7 km wide, consistent with active seismic tomography results [ Canales et al ., 2012; Dunn et al ., 2000]. The minimum shear velocity in the LVZ is about 1.5 km/s immediately below the AML. Using a reference off-axis shear velocity of 3.5 km/s and temperature of 100Â°C at 1.5 km depth [ Henstock et al ., 1993], the velocity anomaly fi in the LVZ suggests a maximum melt fraction of 5% ( lm geometry) to 25% (ellipsoid geometry).  We used the Vp model from seismic tomography by Dunn et al . [2000] and the compliance data at 9Â°33 Nto calibrate the Vs-Vp relationship in the LVZ. The calibration results suggest that d ln Vs /d ln Vp , the ratio between Â­ fi fraction changes in Vs and Vp , is close to 2.0 (a range of 1.8 2.2 gives good t). This has important implications for the melt storage geometry in the LVZ, since d ln Vs /d ln Vp = 2 suggests that melt pockets likely have low &lt; aspect ratio ( 0.01) [ Takei , 2002]. The midcrustal LVZ is commonly considered a crystalline mush zone, in which melt are distributed along grain boundaries [ Wilcock et al ., 1992]. However, d ln Vs /d ln Vp = 2 exceeds the range Â­ for textually equilibrated partial melt (1 1.5) [ Takei , 2002] and indicate that small cracks and sills may also exist in the LVZ. The existence of melt lenses within the LVZ has also been suggested by a recent active source seismic Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011131 fl study that revealed sub-AML re ectors [ Marjanovic et al ., 2013]. The calibration of the Vs-Vp relationship through fl the d ln Vs /d ln Vp ratio proves sea oor compliance to be a useful complimentary tool to seismic tomography in studying the physical properties of partially molten rocks. A small component of the large d ln Vs /d ln Vp value could be attributed to a larger anelastic effect on Vs than for Vp in regions with partial melt because of the lower frequencies used for compliance observations compared to frequencies used in the P wave tomography. 5.3. Along-Axis Variation of Crustal Melt Distribution and Implications for Melt Delivering Processes fl Compliance modeling, combined with seismic re ection and tomography results [ Kent et al ., 1993a, 1993b; Toomey et al ., 2007], allows a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between melt at different depths  in the crust. A crustal LVZ corresponding to a partial melt zone is present along the ridge axis between 9Â°48 N  and 9Â°08 N. The size, asymmetry, and amplitude of its velocity anomaly vary along the ridge, suggesting an   along-axis variation of the melt distribution. The LVZs at 9Â°48 N and 9Â°33 N are of same width and melt  fraction, with the lowest shear velocity of 1.5 km/s immediately below the AML. The LVZ at 9Â°48 N is centered  beneath the ridge axis, while the LVZ at 9Â°33 N is centered about 0.6 km west of the ridge. Imaged widths of "" "" &lt;  Â­  the AML at these two locations are relatively normal ( 0.7 km at 9Â°48 N, 1 1.2 km near 9Â°33 N) [ Kent et al .,   1993a]. The LVZ shifts farther west to the south of the minor discontinuity at 9Â°18 N. At 9Â°18 N the LVZ is  centered 2 km west of the ridge axis. The LVZ is highly asymmetric at 9Â°08 N, near the overlapping spreading center. The center of the LVZ is located approximately 1.5 km west of the ridge axis, but the low-velocity  Â­  region is about twice as wide (13 km) as at 9Â°48 N, extending to 6 8 km west of the ridge axis. At both 9Â°18 N  Â­ and 9Â°08 N an anomalously wide AML has been imaged (3.35 4.15 km) [ Kent et al ., 1993a, 1993b] extending from 0 to 4 km west of the ridge axis. Although the LVZ is generally aligned with the AML along the ridge axis, the size and amount of melt in the LVZ inferred from compliance modeling do not show a systematic correlation with the width of the AML or its  offset from the ridge axis. The LVZ at 9Â°18 N has the highest minimum shear velocity ( Vs ~1.8 km/s) and  probably contains the least amount of melt, whereas the LVZ at 9Â°08 N is twice as wide and probably contains Â­ the highest total volume of melt along EPR 9Â° 10Â°N. Both of these LVZs underlie a wide AML that extends approximately 4 km west of the ridge axis. Our observation is consistent with the proposed hypothesis that AML width is controlled by the transport pathway of melt to the axis rather than by the abundance of melt supply [ Kent et al ., 1993b]. fi A deep DLZ, possibly consisting of interconnected melt- lled sills or cracks, exists near the base of the lower   crust at 9Â°33 Nand 9Â°48 N, where the LVZ is centered close to rise axis and the AML is narrower. In contrast, near    9 08 Nand 9Â°18 N where wider AMLs are imaged and LVZs are further offset from the ridge crest, less melt  appears to accumulate in the lower crust, and no DLZ of size and melt anomaly similar to 9Â°48 N is detected &lt; (a small DLZ of width 2 km cannot be detected by compliance nor excluded). Although melts are negatively buoyant throughout the lower crust, they may be trapped in sills by permeability barriers [ Korenaga and Kelemen , 1998]. The state of tectonic stress may control the existence of these permeability barriers. Near the OSC and spreading discontinuity where greater tectonic stress and higher crack density are expected, melt may penetrate through the crust more easily, and thus, the amount of melt retained in the lower crust is lower. Crustal LVZs do not always align with the center of the uppermost mantle low-velocity zone (MLVZ) imaged from seismic tomography [ Toomey et al ., 2007], which shows along-axis variations rotated at a small angle  from the ridge axis. However, the weakest LVZ at 9Â°18 N does correspond to the largest offset between the LVZ and the MLVZ, which is centered about 10 km east of the ridge axis (Figure 2b of Toomey et al . [2007]). fi The greater misalignment of mantle source and crustal accretion zone may lead to a less ef cient melt   transport and hence a reduced axial melt supply. On the other hand, the MLVZs at 9Â°48 N and 9Â°08 N are centered closer to ridge axis, producing a melt-rich LVZ. Toomey et al . [2007] concluded that the proximity of mantle melt supply to the ridge axis gives rise to enhanced on-axis magmatism and more hydrothermal venting. Our compliance results support this hypothesis by showing that LVZ has lower shear velocity thus more melt where ridge axis is centered above mantle melt source. In summary, there appear to be two levels of control on melt distribution in the subaxial crust. The amount of melt entering the crustal accretion zone from the uppermost mantle source may be controlled by the proximity of the mantle melt source to the ridge axis [ Toomey et al ., 2007], where increasing offset between the morphological ridge axis and the focus of melt delivery in the mantle leads to decreasing melt fraction in Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011131 the crust. At the shallower level, the width of the AML, the offset of the LVZ from the axis, and the abundance of lower crustal melt (DLZ) may be governed by deformation due to the local tectonic stress state and its fi effect on permeability. Higher tectonic stress and higher permeability lead to ef cient vertical melt transport and a wider AML, whereas lower stress may give rise to more melt retention in lower crustal sills.  N: Implication for the Evolution 5.4. Temporal Change of Melt Distribution in the Crust at 9Â°48 of Magmatic System Our compliance data provide direct geophysical evidence for short-term changes in melt distribution at a fast Â­ spreading ridge system. The on-axis compliances measured in 2007, after the 2005 2006 eruption, are fi signi cantly lower than values measured in 1999 (Figure 9a). Compliance modeling suggests that the decrease in compliance corresponds to up to 0.6 km/s increase in shear velocities (from 1.5 to 2.1 km/s) in the LVZ, (Figure 9b), suggesting a decreased amount of melt in the LVZ, implying that melt was extracted from Â­ the LVZ during this period (1999 2007). Using the same method [ Hammond and Humphreys , 2000] to estimate the range of melt fractions, we infer that the maximum melt fraction in the LVZ decreases from Â­ Â­ fi 5 25% in 1999 to 2 9% in 2007. Even using the conservative assumption that melts are stored in thin lms, this suggests up to 3% drop in melt fraction at the center of the LVZ (a relative decrease of 60%). To quantify the change in total melt volume in the LVZ, we calculate the difference in melt fraction between the 1999 model and the 2007 model at each grid point and integrate the difference over the model to get the fi change in total melt volume. We assume a lm geometry, which requires the least change of melt fraction (from 5% to 2%). We do not include possible changes in the DLZ melt fraction since the uncertainty of the 5 3 DLZ velocities in the 2007 model is very high. Our calculation yields a melt volume decrease of 22 Ã— 10 m per meter of spreading ridge. If this decrease is constant along the 18 km of EPR ridge where new lava were 9 3 documented [ Soule et al ., 2007], the total volume of melt decrease is estimated to be 3.93 Ã— 10 m , 2 orders Â­ of magnitude larger than the estimated lava extracted from the AML during the 2005 2006 eruption 7 3 (4.7 Ã— 10 m ,[ Soule et al ., 2007]). Therefore it is highly possible that the decrease of melt fraction is localized  7 3 near the measurement site at 9Â°48 N. On the other hand, a total volume of 4.7 Ã— 10 m of melt removed from the LVZ will only change the melt fraction by a maximum of 0.035% and the shear velocity by 0.007 km/s, which will have a negligible effect on compliance. Therefore, we conclude that the decrease of melt indicated fl by the change of compliance cannot be solely attributed to the extraction due to sea oor eruption. Several other mechanisms may contribute to the apparent decrease in melt fraction: 1. Melt Migration From LVZ to AML The dimensions of the AML and the heat output through hydrothermal activities require decadal melt replenishment of the AML to prevent it from completely freezing [ Ramondenc et al ., 2006]. Geochemical Â­  Â­ analysis of the erupted lava from the 2005 2006 eruption near EPR 9Â°48 N indicates that the 2005 2006 lavas Â­ represent residual melt from the 1991 1992 magmas mixed with melt within the crust, instead of newly injected, primitive mantle melt [ Goss et al ., 2010]. These studies indicate that AML may be replenished from sources within the crust. We suggest that melt migrating into the AML from the LVZ during the measurement Â­ gap period (1999 2007) may partially account for the decreased melt volume in the LVZ. Melt may migrate from the LVZ into the AML through two processes: fractional crystallization and fi posteruption replenishment. In the rst process, magmas stored in the LVZ gradually migrate into the AML Â­ during the repose period leading up to the eruption (1992 2005) [ Goss et al ., 2010], resulting in a decrease fi of melt fraction in the LVZ. The migration of melt through the LVZ could be explained by a lter-pressing mechanism [ Natland and Dick , 2001], in which settling crystals in the LVZ mush squeeze the fractionated liquids upward into the AML [ Mcbirney , 1995]. However, on-axis compliance measurements in 1999 are nearly identical to measurements made in 1994 (Figure 9), while compliance measured in 2007 exhibit a fi fl signi cant decrease from 1999. It seems unlikely that the settling of crystals and upward ow of melt through this mechanism would greatly change rate after 1999 and before the eruption. It is possible, however, that the LVZ was replenished before 1999 by an episodic melt injection from mantle sources. A changing melt geometry may contribute to the apparent decrease of melt fraction. It was shown that as melt fraction decreases, the aspect ratio of melt pockets also change [ Faul et al ., 1994]. Therefore, if fi the melt geometry changes from lm to spheroid as the melt fraction decreases, the apparent change of melt volume will be larger than the actual change. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011131 In the second process, magma pressure drops in the AML during an eruption as magma is withdrawn to form the dikes and extrusive lava, creating a pressure gradient between the AML and the underlying melt reservoir in LVZ [ Nooner and Chadwick , 2009]. In the months following an eruption, the magmas stored in the LVZ could be driven into the AML by this pressure gradient. From continuous monitoring of fl sea oor uplift at Axial Seamount on the Juan de Fuca Ridge, Nooner and Chadwick [2009] observed a rapid, fl fi exponential decaying sea oor uplift over the rst year after the 1998 eruption. They proposed this fl mechanism to explain the rapid sea oor uplift. We suggest that the decrease of melt in the LVZ at the EPR fl may be partly caused by porous ow of melt into the AML driven by this posteruption pressure gradient. fl This process should occur on similar temporal scales as the rapid sea oor uplift recorded at Axial Seamount. Recharge of the LVZ would then occur more slowly during the following years. Repeated compliance measurements following an eruption in the future can help distinguish between these two processes. We note that, however, the AML thickness would increase by ~360 m if all the melt removed from the LVZ 5 2 was transferred to it (assuming a total cross-sectional melt volume of 2.2 Ã— 10 m and an AML width of 600 m [ Kent et al ., 1993a]). This is much thicker than any previous estimate of AML thickness at the EPR [ Collier and Singh ,1998; Kent et al ., 1990; Xu et al ., 2014]. Therefore, melt migration into the AML can only account for part of the melt removed from the LVZ. 2. Feeding Off-Axis Magmatism From Axial LVZ It is possible that the melt in the LVZ also supplies off-axis magmatism at EPR. Previous studies have provided Â­ geophysical and geochemical evidences for off-axis volcanism at EPR 9Â° 10Â°N [ Goldstein et al ., 1994; Troy Â­ Durant and Toomey , 2009]. Recently, Canales et al . [2012] imaged a network of sills 4 8km east of the ridge  axis near 9Â°52 N. The off-axis sill network extends into the axial LVZ, indicating possible interaction between off-axis magmatic system and the axial melt sources. Although no current melt sills were imaged off axis  9Â°48 N, melt could migrate to off-axis regions as well as along-axis through preexisting fractures and pathways, leading to the decrease of melt fraction in the axial LVZ. 3. Decrease of Melt Fraction by Crystallization In addition to melt being removed from the LVZ into the AML or off-axis magmatic systems, melt can crystallize within the LVZ, leading to lower melt fraction and increasing velocities. The latent heat from the fi crystallization of melt is ef ciently transported out of the magmatic system through vigorous hydrothermal circulation near and above the AML [ Morgan and Chen ,1993; Ramondenc et al ., 2006]. The rate of melt supply from the lower crustal and mantle sources may vary temporally, and melt injection may occur episodically rather than continuously. During period of abundant melt supply, the LVZ may contain a higher "" "" amount of melt, acting like a buffer between the AML and mantle source. During a period of reduced melt supply, the rate of crystallization could be faster than the rate of melt input, resulting in a decreasing amount of melt in the LVZ. The following scenario may be consistent with the compliance measurements and the fl  sea oor observations: the EPR near 9Â°48 N underwent a period of high melt supply prior to 1999, leaving excess melt in the LVZ. After 1999, melt supply rate decreased, and more melt crystallized than was injected into the LVZ. Therefore, by 2007, the amount of melt in the LVZ had decreased. More time-dependent numerical modeling studies are needed to quantify the temporal variability of crustal melt fraction due to changing rate of supply and to validate this proposed mechanism. As we discussed in section 4.4, unknown ocean wave directions may introduce some uncertainties to the estimated velocity change and melt fraction change between 1999 and 2007. Additional uncertainty in the change of melt fraction comes from the uncertainty (maximum 10%) in the gain for the pressure data used for the 1994/1999 compliance data. Lower gain values would imply lower compliance values in 1994 and 1999 leading to lower melt fraction estimate in the LVZ before the eruption, reducing the inferred change in fl melt volume. Even with this uncertainty, the attening of the compliance curve (Figure 9) between 1999 and 2007 requires an increase of shear velocities in the LVZ. 5.5. Implications for EPR Crustal Accretion Our compliance data and modeling provide new constraints on the melt distribution and crustal accretion mechanism at fast spreading ridges. Of the existing two end-member models, the gabbro glacier model suggests that the entire oceanic crust section was formed by the crystallization and subsidence of melt at the shallow AML [ Morgan and Chen , 1993; Quick and Denlinger , 1993], while the multisills model suggests that a substantial portion of the lower layered gabbros may have formed through crystallization of melt in sills within the lower crust [ Boudier et al ., 1997; Kelemen et al ., 1997; Korenaga and Kelemen , 1998]. Compliance Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011131 modeling indicates that regions of low shear velocity (DLZ) and high melt fraction exist in the lower crust Â­ (4 7 km) beneath at least part of the EPR between 9Â° and 10Â°N. Melts in the DLZ are likely stored in low aspect fi ratio lms or sills. A portion of melt in the DLZ may crystallize in the sills and subsequently move horizontally away from the ridge, while the remaining melt is transported to either shallower sills or the AML. As the melt moves upward, new permeability barriers may form on a slope at the crystallization front, guiding the melt toward a narrower region [ Hebert and Montesi , 2011]. As melt volume fraction (porosity) increases, sills may become smaller and interconnected and transition into a more isotropic crystalline mush. Melt in the fl mush zone is then driven upward by negative buoyancy through porous ow, until encountering the hydrothermal cooling front and accumulating in a shallow AML. The midcrustal LVZ beneath the AML is probably the largest melt reservoir in the axial crust. A LVZ is present at all crosssectionsof compliancemeasurement sites, butthe size and amount of melt in the LVZ vary from place to place. Recent geochemical analysis of melt inclusion samples at the EPR and the Juan de Fuca Ridge indicates that the majority of phenocrysts in erupted lavas crystallized at depths corresponding to the AML and the LVZ fi [ Wanless and Shaw , 2012], but this does not preclude signi cant crystallization at greater depth, since melts crystallized in deeper crust are less likely to be entrained into the AML and erupted. Given the observed variability of the existence of DLZ and the AML width, we suggest that the portion of lower crust formed in situ at the EPR may vary from place to place. Both the gabbros glacier model and the multisill model could be valid in explaining the formation of the lower crust at fast-to-intermediate spreading centers. The relative importance of the two mechanisms may depend on the local crustal stress state and deviation of mantle melt supply from the ridge axis."

Conclusion fl We have analyzed sea oor compliance measured at 61 sites over four expeditions and a 15 year time span, fl using three-dimensional sea oor compliance modeling to estimate the shear velocity structure of the crust and Â­ uppermost mantle at EPR 9Â° 10Â°N.   Compliance measurements at 9Â°48 Nand 9Â°33 N suggest a deep low-velocity zone (DLZ) in the lower crust, consistent with a region of high melt fraction. Considering the ratio of Vs anomaly from compliance and Vp anomaly from seismic tomography, we suggest that the melt in the lower crust may be stored in connected fi lms or sills rather than in isolated pockets.  Repeated compliance measurements at 9Â°48 N provide direct evidence that the magmatic tapping system at  the EPR evolves over a less than decadal time scale. The observed temporal changes of compliance at 9Â°48 N Â­ fi between prior to and after the 2005 2006 eruption indicate a signi cant decrease of the melt fraction in the fi midcrustal LVZ. The inferred decrease of melt volume signi cantly exceeds the estimated volume of erupted lava and dike from the eruption. Mechanisms that can explain the decrease of melt fraction include melt migration from LVZ to AML, the feeding of off-axis magmatic systems, and crystallization within the LVZ. More repeated compliance measurements in this area or a continuous monitoring system throughout an eruption cycle are needed to distinguish between these mechanisms and to further understand the evolution of the magmatic system in intermediate to fast spreading ridges. Â­ fi Compliance measurements at four cross-axis lines along the EPR 9Â° 10Â°N reveal signi cant variation of crustal melt distribution along the ridge. Sizes and shear velocities of crustal LVZ inferred from compliance do not Acknowledgments exhibit a strong correlation with the width of the imaged AML. DLZs seem to exist where AMLs are narrower The compliance data were collected and mantle melt zones are centered beneath the ridge. These variations suggest that the amount of lower during several cruises on the R/V crustal melt is likely governed by the crustal stress and permeability, rather than the abundance of mantle melt Atlantis , and we thank the captain and crew for their tireless help.

' Seismic tomography studies indicate that the Earth s mantle structure is characterized by [ ] 1 African and Pacific seismically slow velocity anomalies (i.e., superplumes) and circum Pacific seismically fast anomalies (i.e., a globally spherical harmonic degree 2 structure). However, the cause for and time evolution of the African and Pacific superplumes and the degree 2 mantle structure remain poorly understood with two competing proposals. First, the African and Pacific superplumes have remained largely unchanged for at least the last 300 Myr and possibly much longer. Second, the African superplume is formed sometime after the formation of Pangea (i.e., at 330 Ma) and the mantle in the African hemisphere is predominated by cold downwelling structures before and during the assembly of Pangea, while the Pacific superplume has been stable for the Pangea supercontinent cycle (i.e., globally a degree 1 structure before the Pangea formation). Here, we construct a proxy model of plate motions for the African hemisphere for the last 450 Myr since the Early Paleozoic using the paleogeographic reconstruction of continents constrained by paleomagnetic and geological observations. Coupled with assumed oceanic plate motions for the Pacific hemisphere, this proxy model for the plate motion history  is used as time dependent surface boundary condition in three models of thermochemical mantle convection to study the evolution of mantle structure, particularly the African mantle structure, since the Early Paleozoic. Our model calculations  reproduce well the present day mantle structure including the African and Pacific superplumes and generally support the second proposal with a dynamic cause for the superplume structure. Our results suggest that while the mantle in the African hemisphere before the assembly of Pangea is predominated by the cold downwelling structure resulting from plate convergence between Gondwana and Laurussia, it is unlikely that the bulk of  the African superplume structure can be formed before 230 Ma (i.e., assembly of Pangea). Particularly, the last 120 Myr plate motion plays an important role in generating the African superplume. Our models have implications for understanding  the global scale magmatism, tectonics, mantle dynamics, and thermal evolution history for the Earth since the Early Paleozoic.  Zhang, N., S. Zhong, W.

The 3 D Spherical Thermochemical Convection Models With Prescribed Plate Motion  [ ] Our dynamic models of mantle convection in a three 9 dimensional spherical geometry assume an infinite Prandtl number and the Boussinesq approximation.

302 zhang jgrb16365.pdf,RD,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Results [ ] In this section, we present model results for the time 23 evolution of global mantle structure from Pangea time to the   present day and compare present day mantle structure between models and seismic observations (Figure 1) [ Ritsema et al. , 1999]. In total, 22 models are computed with different plate motion history, initial thermal structures, mantle viscosity, convective vigor and other parameters (Table 2). We focus on the evolution of the mantle in the African hemisphere in the last 450 Myr and its effects on global mantle structure. 3.1. Time Evolution of Mantle Structure for Models With Standard Plate Motions [ ] We first present 9 cases (cases FS1 to FS9 in Table 2) 24 that include our proxy model for plate motion history from 458 Ma to the present day (Figure 2). As discussed in section 2.1, the initial thermal and chemical structures for  these calculations include a 1 D temperature profile for the whole mantle and a 250 km thick chemical layer above the CMB. Model calculations for these cases start with the plate motion for the 458 Ma frame (Figure 2c), but this plate motion is maintained for 150 Myr before plate motions are updated with those for later time frames. This modeling procedure is used to take into account of the convergence  between proto Laurussia and Gondwana before 458 Ma [ Scotese , 2001]. A similar procedure was used by Bunge et al. [1998] and McNamara and Zhong [2005] in modeling mantle structure evolution for the last 120 Myr. [ ] We start with our reference case FS1 that has Rayleigh 25 8 number Ra of 2 Ã— 10 , heat generation rate H of 100, and buoyancy number B of 0.5 (Table 2). The precalculation for  this case using free slip boundary conditions yields globally averaged surface motion of 3.6 cm/yr and surface heat flux  70 mW/m2, suggesting that the convective vigor is com- '   parable to the Earth s mantle. A temperature and depth dependent viscosity is used with a nondimensional activation  coefficient, E = 9.2103, that leads to a temperature induced 7of22 B06401 4  viscosity variation of 10 . The depth dependent viscosity includes a weak upper mantle, and a moderately strong lith- osphere and lower mantle (Figure 4a), consistent with that inferred from the geoid studies [e.g., Hager and Richards ,  h 1989]. The depth dependent prefactors ( r ) in equation (9) 0 for the lithosphere and the upper mantle are 1 and 1/30, h respectively (Table 2). For the lower mantle, ( r ) increases 0 linearly from 2.0 at the 670 km depth to 6.8 at the CMB. This leads to a mantle viscosity structure in which the lower mantle  viscosity on average is 2 orders of magnitude higher than 8 that in the upper mantle (Figure 4a). With Ra of 2 Ã— 10 , the averaged viscosities for the upper mantle and lower mantle  19  22 are 7Ã—10 Pa s and 10 Pa s, respectively. Case FS1  2 yields a globally averaged surface heat flux of 84 mW/m for the present day, comparable to the observed [e.g., Pollack et al. , 1993]. The internal heating rate for this case deter-  mined posterior from the surface and CMB heat flux is 61% (Table 2), implying a significant but reasonable fraction of heating from the core [e.g., Zhong , 2006; Leng and Zhong , 2008]. [ ] For case FS1, temperature fields at 2750 km depth at 26  458, 330, 250, 195, and 120 Ma, and for the present day are  shown in Figure 5, and 3 D mantle thermochemical structures at 330 Ma, 120 Myr ago and the present day are presented in Figure 6. Together, they show significant time dependence in mantle structures, particularly in the African hemisphere. Before Laurussia and Gondwana collides at 330 Ma to form Pangea, the convergence between these two major continental plates results in cold downwellings in the African mantle. The downwelling materials sweep the chemically dense materials to the Pacific hemisphere and below the south Gondwana to form largely a single pile above the CMB (Figures 5a, 5b, and 6a). The chemical piles accumulate below the south Gondwana because of the reduced convergence rate between Gondwana and the Pacific plates with Gondwana moving northward (e.g., Figure 2c). After the formation of Pangea, the convergence between Laurussia and Gondwana stops, and  the circum Pangea subduction causes significant reorgani- zation of mantle structure in the African hemisphere. Partic- ularly, subduction at the southeast side of Pangea breaks the c(""chemical pile into two and sweeps part of the chemically"", ""dense materials toward the African hemisphere (Figures 5c"", ""and 5d). Eventually, a major hot upwelling system over-"", ""riding a major chemical pile forms in the African hemisphere"", ""(Figures 5e, 5f, 6c, and 6e).

[ ] We now present three calculations (cases FS_L2, 45 PS250_L2, and PS120_L2 in Table 2) to examine how the African superplume structure, if it exists in the geological history (e.g., before the Pangea), responds to the plate motion history in our proxy model. These calculations have implica-  tions for the hypotheses of long term stability for the African and Pacific superplume structure [ Burke et al. , 2008; Torsvik et al. , 2008a]. Case FS_L2 differs from case FS1 only in the initial thermochemical structure which is taken from the  present day thermochemical structure of case FS1 with the well developed African and Pacific superplumes (Figure 5f, 6e, 6f, and 11a). The purpose is to examine how the imposed plate convergence between Laurussia and Gondwana and the resulting cold downwelling slabs before Pangea formation would affect the initially prescribed African superplume structure. We found that the initially prescribed African superplume structure is greatly displaced southwards by the downwelling slabs and is largely erased by the time of Pangea formation (Figure 11b and 11d). In fact, at the time of Pangea formation and for the present day, the mantle structures from case FS_L2 are very similar to those from case FS1 at the corresponding times (Figures 11b and 11c). The smaller size for the African structure at the present day for case FS_L2 (Figure 11c), compared to its initial structure (Figure 11a), is caused by the entrainment. [ ] Cases PS250_L2 and PS120_L2 use the same initial 46 condition (i.e., two superplumes) as in case FS_L2, but are computed with plate motion history for the last 250 and 120 Myr (i.e., after the Pangea formation), respectively. We found that for these two cases, the plate motion history for the last 120 and 250 Myr does not significantly modify the overall structures of the African and Pacific super- plumes (Figures 11e and 11f), compared to their initial struc- tures (Figure 11a). However, the positions and boundaries of the superplumes are not stationary. For example, in case PS120_L2, the west boundary of the African superplume  or chemical pile migrates westward by 20Â° for the last 120 Myr (Figure 11f). In case PS250_L2, the west boundary  of the African pile first migrates eastward for 15Â° between 250 and 170 Ma and then reverses the direction to migrate back to nearly its initial positions at the present day (Figure 11e). Therefore, cases FS_L2, PS120_L2 and PS250_L2 with ini- tially two superplumes and chemical piles further demon- strate that the chemical piles dynamically interact with mantle flows. Discussion [ ] In this study, we constructed a proxy model of global 47 plate motion for the last 450 Myr in which the continental plates for the African hemisphere are constrained by pub- lished paleogeography of continents, while the oceanic plates for the Pacific hemisphere are assumed to be predominated by divergent plate motions.

Especially, convection models show strong degree 3 structure above 1200 km depth (Figure 8b) that is not present in the seismic model (Figure 1b). This seems to be counterintuitive because with the imposed plate motion history, one would expect that the shallow mantle structure be matched better. There are a number of possible reasons. 1) Seismic models have nonuniform resolution due to uneven path coverage (e.g., for the shallow mantle). This would suggest that more vigorous comparison techniques, such as those con- sidering resolution operator [e.g., Ritsema et al. , 2007; Bull et al. , 2009] may be needed. 2) Our convection models ignore features such as 410 km and 670 km phase changes and continental keels at the shallow mantle, and postperoskite phase change at the large depths that may cause the reduced correlations at those depths. 3) A significant fraction of mantle materials at the relatively shallow mantle away from subduction zones may be derived from the deep mantle from more distant past and carry the thermal and structure history that is beyond what our convection models can resolve. Future studies should attempt to address these issues. [ ] Finally, we wish to point out that the models presented 59  here did not consider possible composition dependent vis-  cosity [e.g., McNamara and Zhong , 2004a] and composition dependent equation of state [e.g., Tan and Gurnis , 2005] for the dense components that may affect the morphology of the chemical piles above the CMB. We also ignored phase changes (e.g., at the 670 km depth and near the CMB) and did not consider purely thermal convection in our models [e.g., Bull et al. , 2009]. Our models can also be benefited from adding the plate reconstruction for the Pacific hemisphere at 140 Ma [ Muller et al. , 2008]. While we do not think that these effects will significantly impact our main results including time evolution of the mantle structures, it is important to consider these effects in future studies."
302 zhang jgrb16365.pdf,C,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Conclusions [ ] This work investigates time evolution of mantle 60 structure in the African hemisphere and as well as on a global scale for the last supercontinent cycle since 450 Ma, using   3 D spherical mantle convection models that include time dependent plate motion as the surface velocity boundary   condition, depth and temperature dependent viscosity, and chemically dense piles above the CMB. Our results can be summarized as the follows. [ ] 1. We constructed a proxy model for global plate 61 motion for the last 450 Myr. For the last 119 Myr, the global  plate motion of Lithgow Bertelloni and Richards [1998] was used. Before 119 Ma, the plate motion history for the African hemisphere was constrained by paleogeographic reconstruction of continents [ Scotese , 2001], while divergent plate motions similar to that at 119 Ma are assumed for the Pacific hemisphere.  [ ] 2. Using the proxy plate motion model as time 62 dependent boundary conditions, we showed that our con- vection models with relatively small buoyancy number   ( 0.5) reproduce well the basic features of the present day mantle structure including the African and Pacific super- plumes and chemical piles, and a predominantly degree 2 structure throughout the lower mantle. B06401 ZHANG ET AL.: MANTLE STRUCTURE SINCE PALEOZOIC [ ] 3. Our models demonstrated that the mantle in the 63 African hemisphere around the Pangea time is predominated by cold downwellings resulting from the convergence between Gondwana and Laurussia. The downwellings sweep aside the  chemical piles from most of the African mantle. The present day African superplume structure may not have been formed  until 100 Ma after Pangea formation, as a result of upwelling  return flow in response to the circum Pangea subduction. [ ] 4. The mantle in the Pacific hemisphere is pre- 64 dominated by a major upwelling system since the Pangea time, as a result of the assumed divergent plate motions there. Our calculations suggest that there cannot be significant plate  convergence for the last 300 Myr in the Pacific hemisphere. Our model results are consistent with the hypothesis by Zhong et al. [2007] for the time evolution of mantle structure in the African hemisphere and on a global scale in relation to supercontinent cycles, as well as the geodynamic history hypothesized for the Rodinia supercontinent cycle [ Li et al. , 2004, 2008; Li and Zhong , 2009].

45 chen jgrb51019.pdf,I,Journal of Geophysical Research,"1. Introduction Our East Asia study region (Figure 1) is bordered by the Himalaya Main Boundary Thrust and the Tianshan Mountain Range in the west, the Japan and Izu-Bonin-Mariana Trenches in the east, Lake Baikal in the north, and Malaysia and the Philippines in the south. This region has drawn much attention due to its complex tectonic history involving continent-continent collision, oceanic plate subduction, various types of basin formation, intracontinental rifting, and intraplate volcanism and magmatism. The main driving forces of these tectonic activities have been attributed to the India-Eurasia collision in the west [ AllÃ©gre et al ., 1984; fi Tapponnier et al ., 1986; Dewey et al ., 1989; Burch el and Royden , 1991; Yin and Harrison , 2000] and subduction fi of the Paci c Plate beneath Eurasia in the east [ Northrup et al ., 1995; Honza and Fujioka , 2004; Schellart and Lister , 2005]. The southwest margin and neighboring regions have undergone massive compression due to the India-Eurasia collision. This continent-continent collision created not only the highest mountain system on earth but also the most elevated and largest plateau: the Tibetan Plateau with an average elevation of 4.5 km and an area of 2.5 million square kilometers. Convergence of the Indian and Eurasian plates, besides being absorbed by the Himalayan orogeny and uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, was also partially accommodated by very large sinistral and dextral fault systems, such as the Karakorum, Kunlun, and Altyn-Tagh Faults [ Tapponnier et al ., 1986]. The fi fl other signi cant topographic features resulting from this collision are numerous exural basins, such as the Tarim, Junggar, and Qaidam Basins [ Watson et al ., 1987]. Previous seismic imaging studies have revealed high wave speed (high-V) Indian Plate subducting beneath the Tibetan plateau and low wave speed (low-V) zones residing in the sub-Tibetan lower crust and uppermost mantle [ Brandon and Romanowicz ,1986; Bourjot and Romanowicz ,1992; Tilmann et al ., 2003; Priestley and Mckenzie ,2006; Li et al ., 2008; Yao et al ., 2010; Panning c(""et al"", ""., 2012;"", ""Yang et al"", ""., 2012]. However, the northern extent of Indian Plate subduction and whether or not uplift"", ""of the Tibetan Plateau is due to a low-V crustal weak zone are still heatedly debated topics, mainly due to limited"", ""seismic imaging resolution."", ""The eastern margin of East Asia experienced widespread extension due to subduction of the Paci"", ""fi"", ""c plate"", ""and slab rollback.

Pronounced deep slow anomalies are located beneath Hainan and the South China Sea. Despite all the similar features on large scales, differences exist among these tomographic results due to different methodologies and/or data sets. For example, compared to shear wave speed anomalies from surface wave and shear wave studies beneath the eastern Tibetan Plateau [ Lebedev and van der Hilst ,2008; Obrebski et al ., 2012], which Â­ indicate high-V anomalies in the 100 km 200 km depth range, a compressional wave study [ Li et al ., 2008] suggests low-V anomalies instead. Differences also exist among various compressional wave tomographic models. The crust and upper mantle beneath the Tarim and Junggar Basins, between their basements and 200 km depth, appear as high-V anomalies in the compressional wave speed tomography study by Huang and Zhao [2006] but as relatively low-V anomalies in the study by Li and van der Hilst [2010]. Discrepancies among different compressional wave speed and shear wave speed models limit further interpretation. Given the current state of tomography of East Asia, there are several notable advantages in using adjoint tomography [ Tromp et al ., 2005; Liu and Tromp , 2006, 2008; Chen et al ., 2007; Tape et al ., 2007, 2009, 2010; Fichtner et al ., 2009, 2010; Zhu et al ., 2012a, 2012b] to obtain more coherent and robust images of both compressional and shear wave speeds. (1) Adjoint tomography eliminates crustal corrections, which are required in traditional body wave and surface wave tomography. Instead, a 3-D crustal model is embedded in the initial model and gets updated at each iteration. (2) All usable segments in seismograms, including body and surface waves, are used in the inversion for a more compatible model that improves fi the overall synthetic waveform t to the data. (3) Simultaneously inverting for multiple parameters of a radially anisotropic model provides more constraints on the nature of seismic anomalies. (4) An iterative fi gradient-based minimization scheme supplemented by more accurate nite-frequency kernels better recovers wave speed anomaly amplitudes. (5) Accurate forward waveform modeling is a natural component of the iterative inversion process. fi In this paper we present the rst adjoint tomography model of East Asia, which describes 3-D crust and upper mantle structure in terms of isotropic shear wave speed V , isotropic compressional wave speed V , and S P  Ã€ radial anisotropy =( V V )/ V (where V and V denote the wave speeds of horizontally traveling SH SV S SH SV and horizontally and vertically polarized shear waves, respectively). Our model contains high-V slab features at greater depths consistent with previous studies but exhibits improved correlations between wave speed anomalies in the upper 100 km and surface tectonic units. Here we focus on presenting the technical details of model construction, including discussions of the data set, inversion method, and model quality. We also provide a very general discussion of the model based on comparisons with existing models. The second part of this study, a detailed model interpretation guided by radial anisotropy and the V / V ratio P S to probe rheological and compositional properties that affect seismic waveforms, will be presented in a subsequent publication."
45 chen jgrb51019.pdf,M,Journal of Geophysical Research,"2. Data and Method We use three-component waveforms recorded by 1869 stations from F-net, CEArray [ Zheng et al ., 2009], NECESSArray, INDEPTH IV Array, and other regional and global seismic Networks (Figure 2). The large majority of seismic sensors are broadband (50 Hz to 60 s or 120 s). Only a small percentage of the sensors are ultrabroadband (50 Hz to 360 s) and short-period borehole installations (50 Hz to 1 s or 2 s). The station distribution map indicates a phenomenal data coverage, especially to the east of 90Â°E within China. From the Â­ global centroid moment tensor (CMT) solution database, we select 227 earthquakes ( Mw =5 7) (black and red beach balls in Figure 2) that have high signal-to-noise-ratio records for both source and structural inversions, and an extra set of 39 earthquakes not used in the inversions for model validation (green beach balls in fi Figure 2). In order to increase wave eld coverage for the structural inversion, we try to include earthquakes (black and red beach balls in Figure 2) located in all azimuths with respect to CEArray stations, which compose the main component of our data set. However, due to limited data availability, the chosen earthquakes are mainly distributed in seismogenic zones associated with active subduction or tectonic deformation and faulting, such as the subduction zones of Japan, Izu-Bonin, Mariana, Ryukyu, Philippine, Himalaya, and Burma. Only a few earthquakes are located to the west and north of China, close to Pamir, Tianshan, and Lake Baikal. Several earthquakes occurred inland in the Longmenshan fault zone, where the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake ruptured. c(""Our inversion involves reinverting source parameters within the initial 3-D model and iteratively re"", ""fi"", ""ning the"", ""model based on"", ""fi"", ""nite-frequency kernels.

Model Quality Assessment Before diving into the interpretation of features observed in the new seismic images, we need to assess the quality of model EARA2014. This will ensure that later interpretations are well founded on faithful mapping of ' information contained in seismic waveforms to elastic properties of the Earth s interior. Our model quality assessment focuses on two aspects, namely, methodology and data coverage. We assess model quality by fi examining waveform mis t reduction, establishing regions with reasonably good data coverage, comparisons with previous tomographic models, performing resolution tests at several locations of interest, and an inversion with a different initial model. 3.1. Waveform Fitting fi Compared to the initial model, nal model EARA2014 predicts 3-D wave propagation much better, as illustrated in Figure 3. Adjoint tomography takes three-component body waves in all three frequency bands, and surface Â­ waves in the intermediate- and long-period passbands as inputs. Figures 3b 3d show examples of waveforms recorded by a station in Tibet from an intermediate-depth earthquake (170 km depth, Figure 3a). Although Â­ the inversion only assimilates measurements in selected windows (grey boxes in Figures 3b 3d), the waveform fi t (both phase and amplitude) improves not only in these windows but also in segments of the seismograms that were not selected initially. These improvements are most prominent for wave trains arriving much later Â­ than the main body wave phases. In the short-period passband (12 s 40 s), later arriving phases contain fl fi short-period surface waves and multire ected body waves, showing good ts between EARA2014 synthetics and the data (Figure 3b), especially considering the complex crustal structure these waves have propagated fi fi through.

Therefore, it also serves as a good proxy for data coverage, indicating model regions that are well resolved given the data coverage. We chose preconditioner values over a certain threshold to highlight regions with reasonably good data coverage at each depth. Figure S7 shows that, with increasing depth, the resolvable area shrinks. In the crustal Â­ and uppermost mantle depth range (20 km 250 km), the resolvable region includes China, southernmost Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, N. Korea, S. Korea, Japan, Burma, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, the Philippines, the Philippine Sea, the Japan Sea, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea. Between depths of 250 km and 600 km, data coverage diminishes in southernmost East Asia, e.g., in Malaysia, Cambodia, and southern Vietnam. Between 600 km and 900 km, resolution is further lost in southernmost Russia, Kazakhstan, the southwestern part of the South China Sea, Thailand, Burma, and the eastern part of the Philippine Sea. In maps showing EARA2014 model parameters, unresolved regions are masked out for preconditioner values below the threshold. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011638 Figure 7.

Comparison of radial anisotropy, =( V V )/ V , between EARA2014 and S362ANI (the initial model) at SH SV S 100 km depth. V is the Voigt-Reuss-Hill average shear wave speed. S surface wave study by Chen et al . [2009] shows certain radial anisotropy patterns similar to EARA2014 at 100 km depth, for example, positive anisotropy beneath the Lhasa Block and strong negative anisotropy beneath Burma, the southern Chuandian Block, and the Sichuan Basin but other patterns different from EARA2014, such as negative anisotropy in the western Qiangtang Block and the eastern Tarim Basin, where EARA2014 displays positive anisotropy. Different model parameterizations and data coverage can lead to differences in radial anisotropy between our model and previous models. Previous regional studies are mostly based on surface wave analyses, and models are parameterized with radial anisotropy in both the crust and the mantle. Our study limits shear wave radial anisotropy between the Moho and the 650 km discontinuity. EARA2014 radial anisotropy is constrained by not only surface waves but also body waves on three components. However, we cannot rule fi out that small wavelength anisotropy patterns in EARA2014 may be arti cial and can be caused by tradeoff between isotropic heterogeneities and anisotropy [ Bodin et al ., 2015]. Further tests of the robustness of EARA2014 radial anisotropy are needed to ensure a correct model interpretation. In the next section we investigate some of these tradeoffs based on the point spread function. 3.4. Point Spread Function Tests for Locations of Interest fi The resolving capability of adjoint tomography is dif cult to assess, as routine checkerboard tests are computationally prohibitive and provide limited information [ LÃ©vÃªque et al ., 1993; Fichtner and Trampert , 2011a, 2011b]. On top of that, because checkerboard tests bear the same theoretical foundation as the adjoint tomographic inversion, the accuracy of the methodology itself is impossible to examine [ Qin et al ., 2008]. The latest resolution analysis method in full waveform inversion, based on the Fourier-domain approximate Hessian proposed by Fichtner and Trampert [2011b], overcomes the limitations of checkerboard tests and provides additional useful information, such as image distortion and resolution length, while being relatively fi computationally ef cient (about six conjugate gradient iterations). However, the implementation of such a method is beyond the scope of this study. Instead, following Zhu et al . [2012b], we chose to perform simpler "" "" and more straightforward point spread function (PSF) tests to evaluate local resolution for a few locations fi of interest and to probe the degree of image blurring and distortion of the nal model. The PSF test evaluates "" "" the resolution of a particular point of interest in the model by the degree of blurring of a perturbation located at that point and by revealing the tradeoff with other model parameters. We added perturbations represented by 3-D Gaussians at eight locations of interest, with a 120 km radius and a maximum Â±4% perturbation at the center (Figure S10). Although there is a certain degree of smearing, the V PSFs recover the main features SV fi of the perturbations while exhibiting negligible tradeoff with V and V ,con rming that V wave speed SH C SV anomalies are well resolved in the following regions: (1) low-V beneath the Altay-Sayan Mountain Range in the upper mantle (Figure S10a); (2) low-V beneath the Changbai and Hainan volcanoes at the bottom of the mantle transition zone (Figures S10b and S10d); (3) high-V beneath the Yangtze Platform inside the mantle transition zone (Figure S10c); (4) low-V beneath the northern Philippine Sea Plate in the upper mantle (Figure S10e); (5) high-V beneath the West Philippine Basin in the uppermost mantle (Figure S10f); (6) high-V Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011638 Figure 12.

Maps of shear wave speed anomalies are shown on the left, and maps of radial anisotropy on the right.

Tradeoffs between V and V or V are negligible in these regions, given the V or V Hessian SV SH C SH C fi kernel maps appear to have zero amplitude, which gives con dence in future interpretation of radial anisotropy and V / V ratios. P S 3.5. Test With a Different Initial Model At depths of 150 km, 200 km, and 250 km, the large-scale high-V beneath central and western China and low-V beneath eastern China do not change much from the S362ANI starting model, although short-wavelength variations (Figure 8), including narrow high-V slabs, do emerge from the smooth starting model (Figure S11). Thus, the question arises whether EARA2014 is robustly constrained by our data set in this depth range. In order to answer this question, we restart the adjoint inversion with a different initial model in which EARA2014 is replaced by 1-D model STW105 [ Kustowski et al ., 2008a] between 100 km and 300 km depth; the rest of the model remains the same as EARA2014. After six iterations, model T06 (Figure 12) reassuringly shows shear wave speed anomalies and radial anisotropy patterns very similar to EARA2014 in the 100 km to 300 km depth range. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011638 The results of this test indicate that long-wavelength wave speed and anisotropy patterns are robustly constrained by our data set in this depth range. Especially the positive radial anisotropy across eastern China at 200 km depth seems to be preferred by our data set. However, the amplitudes of the wave speed anomalies fl fi and radial anisotropy are reduced by roughly a third compared to EARA2014. This may re ect an insuf cient number of tomographic iterations in the adjoint inversion, or convergence to a local minimum due to an improper starting model."

Results and Discussions  Ã€ Isotropic V and V anomalies and radial anisotropy =( V V )/ V are shown in maps at constant depth S P SH SV S (Figures 8, 10, and 11). All maps are also plotted for the initial model for comparison (Figures S11, S12, and 11). The isotropic V and V images (Figures 8 and 10) generally agree in terms of wave speed anomaly patterns, but S P EARA2014-S (Figures 8) involves much sharper images of slabs and wave speed contrasts across the main tectonic boundaries, primarily due to the higher shear wave speed sensitivity of traveltimes. Therefore, we focus on describing the V model. S V V 4.1. Map Views of Isotropic and Anomalies S P Quite a few features in EARA2014 (Figures 8 and 10) are consistent with previous tomographic results [ Huang and Zhao , 2006; Li and van der Hilst , 2010; Obayashi et al ., 2013; Schaeffer and Lebedev , 2013]. High-V anomalies beneath the Ordos Block and the Yangtze Platform indicate cold stable cratonic roots extending Â­ down to depths of about 250 km 300 km. Narrow high-V ( V and V ) slabs appear from a depth of 100 km to P S the top of the mantle transition zone (depth of 400 km), following the trenches of Burma, Andaman, Kuril, Japan, Izu-Bonin, Mariana, Yap, Ryukyu, Malina, and the Philippines. Stagnant slabs reside inside the mantle transition zone (depths of 500 km and 600 km) beneath eastern China (east of 100Â°E) and are fragmented into different high-V zones, possibly corresponding to different episodes of slab subduction and retreat since the late Mesozoic [ Fukao et al ., 2001; Honza and Fujioka , 2004; Li and van der Hilst , 2010]. Alternatively, high-V anomalies observed inside the mantle transition zone beneath the Yangtze Platform could be lithosphere left by the collision between the South and North China Blocks [ Lebedev and Nolet , 2003], and the high-V anomalies under the central and eastern North China Blocks are likely fossil lithosphere delaminated during an early Cretaceous giant igneous event [ Wu et al ., 2005; Yang et al ., 2008]. High-V anomalies below the mantle transition zone (depths of 700 km and 900 km) imply that ancient oceanic or continental lithosphere penetrated the 650 km discontinuity and sank into the lower mantle beneath the North China Block, the Chuandian Block, the Northeast China Block, and the Ryukyu, Izu-Bonin, and Mariana Trenches. Broad low-V zones persist to a depth of 300 km beneath four regions, namely, the South China Sea, the Okinawa Trough, the West Philippine Basin, and the region to the east of Lake Baikal. These regions are possibly associated with slab subduction and stagnation or plume-induced upwellings. Moderate low-V zones appear in the lower mantle at a depth of 700 km beneath both the Japan Sea and the South China Sea, suggesting a possible lower mantle plume contribution to volcanism at Changbai and Hainan [ Lebedev and Nolet , 2003; Montelli et al ., 2004]. The main characteristics of EARA2014 include highly improved image clarity, especially in the crust and uppermost mantle (the uppermost 100 km), and newly imaged strong wave speed anomalies. At a depth of &gt; &lt; Ã€ 50 km (Figure 8), the sharp transition from high-V ( 5 %) to low-V ( 5 %) anomalies clearly marks tectonic boundaries between the Nanshan Basin and the Altay-Sayan Mountain Range, the Tarim Basin and the Songpan Ganzi Fold Belt, and the Sichuan Basin and the Chuandian Block. At a depth of 100 km (Figure 8), &gt; high-V ( 3 %) regions perfectly capture the shapes of the Tarim Basin, the Ordos Block, and the Yangtze Platform. From a depth of 150 km to the top of the transition zone, narrow slabs are crisply and continuously fi de ned by higher than 1.5 % V anomalies, in particular, for the relatively colder and younger Japan and S fi Izu-Bonin slabs, which are de ned by higher than 3 % V anomalies. S There are several strong wave,speed anomalies in EARA2014 images associated with tectonic features Ã€ (Figure 8): (1) strong low-V zones with lower than 5% V anomalies coincident with long and narrow back-arc S basins of convergent plate margins in the uppermost 100 km (depths of 20 km and 50 km), possibly associated fl with magma genesis from subduction-driven mantle ow, decompression melting, and slab dehydration [ Pearce and Stern , 2006]; (2) a strong low-V zone correlated with the Altay-Sayan Mountain Range persists from Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011638 the crust to the uppermost mantle (depths of 20 km, 50 km, and 100 km), likely affected by an underlying mantle Ã€ plume or asthenospheric diapir [ Cunningham , 1998]; (3) strong low-V zones (lower than 5% V anomalies) S exist beneath the northern Qiangtang Block [ Brandon and Romanowicz , 1986; Bourjot and Romanowicz , 1992], the Songpan Ganzi Fold Belt, the Qilian Fold, and the Chuandian Block in the mid to lower crust (depths of fl 20 km and 50 km), which may support the existence of partial melt and/or aqueous uid beneath the Tibetan Plateau [ Yao et al ., 2008; Caldwell et al ., 2009; Bai et al ., 2010; Chen et al ., 2014]; (4) in the crust and uppermost mantle (depths of 20 km and 50 km), high-V anomalies correspond to the East Gobi and Erlian Basins right ' next to each other, the Songliao Basin in northeastern China, and low-V anomalies mark the Great Xing an Range in between; (5) beneath the Tibetan Plateau, across the Lhasa and Qiangtang Block, a broad subvertical north dipping high-V structure (higher than 1.5 % in both V and V ; Figures 8 and 9) extends down to the P S Â­ bottom of the mantle transition zone (depths of 150 km 650 km), consistent at long-wavelength with the high-V anomalies in the latest global model SL2013sv [ Schaeffer and Lebedev , 2013] (Figure 7) but missing in many other tomographic images [ Huang and Zhao ,2006; Li and van der Hilst , 2010; Obrebski et al ., 2012; Wei et al ., 2012; Obayashi et al ., 2013]. 4.2. Map Views of Radial Anisotropy  Ã€ Radial anisotropy, i.e., =( V V )/ V , is frequently determined from surface wave dispersion and is usually SH SV S explained in terms of transverse isotropy with a vertical symmetry axis. It is a good indicator of lithospheric fl deformation in the crust and mantle, or mantle ow in the asthenosphere in either the vertical direction   (negative ) or horizontal direction (positive ). Our inversion parameterizes radial anisotropy beneath the Moho and above 650 km (the bottom of the mantle transition zone), because complex crustal structure can introduce a strong trade-off between anisotropy and heterogeneity, and lower mantle radial anisotropy is not well constrained by our regional data set. It should be noted that the seismic waves we used to constrain radial anisotropy include not only surface waves but also all available body waves traveling in the upper mantle, especially P , S , PP , and SS . These complementary body waves increase the spatial resolution of radial n n fi anisotropy. Of course, there are other anisotropic parameters besides the ve Love parameters that control wave propagation, for example, J , J , G , and G [ Montagner and Nataf , 1986; Chen and Tromp , 2007]. We C S C S fi assume that the ve Love parameters [ Love , 1927] dominate wave propagation and provide a simple fl indicator of large-scale tectonic deformation styles, in particular, vertically or horizontally dominated ow. fi Future studies may focus on other elastic parameters given suf cient data coverage [ Sieminski et al ., 2007a, 2007b, 2009; Zhu and Tromp , 2013].  At a depth of 100 km (Figure 11), radial anisotropy is qualitatively anticorrelated with V anomalies (Figure 8) S in most regions of East Asia, except the east Tarim Basin, the north Ordos Block, and parts of the back-arc basins in the marginal seas of Japan, eastern China, and southern China. Low-V regions are dominated by  positive radial anisotropy ( higher than 3 %) beneath the Tibetan Plateau, the Altay-Sayan Mountain Range, ' part of the Nanshan Basin, the northern Ordos Block, the Xing an-East Mongolia Block, the Northeast China  &lt; Ã€ Block, and the Philippine Sea Plate. Narrow zones of negative ( 3 %) are mainly associated with arcs and  back-arc basins. Medium to weakly negative corresponds to high-V stable cratons, such as the Yangtze Platform, the western Tarim Basin, as well as the eastern part of the North China Block. At a depth of 200 km (Figure 12), anticorrelation between radial anisotropy and V anomalies is not obvious, S except along major arcs. Such a change in radial anisotropy relative to V anomalies in the 100 km to 200 km S depth range could indicate a compositional transition from lithospheric to asthenospheric mantle (or vice fl versa), or a change in mantle ow modulated by lithosphere root architecture. Strong negative radial anisotropy  &lt; Ã€ ( 3 %) mostly exists beneath the marginal seas, eastern China, southeastern Tibet, Burma, and West and South Yunnan. Medium to weakly positive radial anisotropy occurs beneath the Philippine Sea Plate, western China, and Mongolia. Negative radial anisotropy associated with arcs and back arcs persists at 200 km depth.  &gt; Most of the strongly positive radial anisotropy ( 3 %) in EARA2014 (Figure 11) is limited to the upper 150 km of the mantle and coincides with the depth range of a hypothetical shear zone between the lithosphere and asthenosphere, where the preferred orientation of the olivine fast axis is horizontal [ Ribe ,1989].Negative  &lt; Ã€ radial anisotropy ( 1.5 %) generally correlates with intraplate volcanoes at depths deeper than 150 km (Figure 12), such as the Wudalianchi, Changbai, Hainan, Tengchong, and Arshan volcanoes. Negative radial  &lt; Ã€ anisotropy ( 1.5 %) also occurs in subduction zones within both the slab and the mantle wedge (Figures 11 and 12). However, radial anisotropy in these two regions can be caused by different mechanisms. We speculate Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011638 that there are different origins of strong negative radial anisotropy in the mantle wedge above the slab versus within the slab. Atop of the subducting slab, mantle downwelling due to the drag force of the subducting slab induces large strain enabling perfect downdip alignment of olivine crystals. Thus, negative radial anisotropy in fl the mantle wedge (Figures 11 and 12) is possibly a manifestation of ow-oriented olivine. In contrast, radial anisotropy within the slab (Figures 11 and 12) may represent extrinsic anisotropy, for example, an equivalent fi apparent negative radial anisotropy induced by ne planar layering inside the slab oriented subvertically fi [ Wang et al ., 2013]. We con rm subduction zone radial anisotropy reported in previous studies [ Panning and Romanowicz ,2006; Yeh et al ., 2013] but provide much higher resolution images that start to reveal a link between the mantle dynamics and radial anisotropy."

This paper focuses on technical aspects of constructing the model and provides a general discussion by comparing V , isotropic V and V , and radial anisotropy images of EARA2014 with other SV S P models. Wave speed anomalies in EARA2014 are highly localized within known tectonic units and show very sharp contrasts across tectonic boundaries in the uppermost 100 km. We observe a broad high-V structure beneath Tibet (higher than 1.5 % in both V and V ), spanning across the Lhasa and Qiangtang Block, and P S extending from below 100 km depth to the bottom of the mantle transition zone. Detailed interpretations of certain tectonic features, such as the Tibetan Plateau and the Altay-Sayan Mountain Range, with additional constrains from radial anisotropy and the V / V ratio, will be presented in a separate paper. P S Future inversions using this data set will focus on 3-D variations in azimuthal anisotropy and attenuation beneath East Asia.

Bonaccorso, A. Bonforte, and G. Currenti Received 29 May 2013; revised 5 September 2013; accepted 7 September 2013; published 19 September 2013. We investigated the evolution of seismicity and deformation in the unstable eastern [ ] 1 fl ank of Etna volcano over a 30 year period (from 1980 to 2012). A signi fl correlation has been revealed between periods of ank acceleration and intensi activity by comparing seismicity along the northern border (Pernicana fault system) of the fl fl sliding ank and the deformation of the eastern ank. Two marked phases have been Â­ observed in 1984 1986 and in the years following 2002. These two phases are separated by fl an intermediate phase from 1987 to 2001, in which the ank sliding slowed down and the seismicity dropped drastically. This common temporal evolution in the deformation rate and seismic release supports the hypothesis that the seismicity in the northern border can be viewed as a marker of the response to accommodate the stress exerted by the traction of the fl eastern ank sliding. This interplay has also been corroborated by numerical computations that highlight a good correlation between the seismicity pattern and areas of positive stress changes induced by the sliding surface. The two intense phases of fl ank acceleration are representative of two main different sources: volcano fi Â­ stretching the eastern sector in the rst 1984 1986 phase and magmatic intrusions pushing fl Â­ the eastern ank seaward since the 2002 2003 eruption. Establishing the relationship fl between ank acceleration and seismic activation therefore contributes to understanding ' Etna s mechanical behavior and provides insights into the processes regulating the unstable fl ank response.

Volcano ank dynamics can be fl in uenced by different phenomena such as magma intrusion, earthquake shaking [e.g., Voight and Elsworth , 1997], fi hydrothermal alteration, and edi ce shape [e.g., Elsworth fl and Day , 1999]. Moreover, the mobile ank of a volcano fi edi ce is typically marked by incipient or active fault systems, which are subjected to seismic or aseismic defor- mation. In such a case, the interaction between magmatic and tectonic processes may contribute to destabilize large fi portions of the volcano edi ce [e.g., McGuire , 1996; Voight and Elsworth , 1997].

At Etna volcano, the fl eastern ank is currently affected by a near continuous ESE seaward sliding that is well detected by ground defor- mation measurements. It is also accompanied by seismicity concentrated along the NNW-SSE trending Timpe fault system crossing this volcano sector (TFS in Figure 1) and fi mainly along its well-de ned northern border, known as the Pernicana fault system (PFS), one of the most active seismogenetic structures on Etna (Figure 1). The PFS is "" "" characterized by both aseismic continuous slow move- fl ments associated with the eastern ank sliding and also by fast ruptures, generating earthquakes that often occur as swarm sequences. [ ] In the last decade, several studies have provided help- 4 fl ful information on ank instability using geophysical data [ Acocella et al ., 2013 and references therein]. Several model- ing approaches have also been used to investigate the fl volcano sources controlling and triggering the ank instabil- ity [e.g., Walter et al ., 2005; Battaglia et al ., 2011; Cianetti et al ., 2012; Apuani et al ., 2013].

5 alparone jgrb50364.pdf,M,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Structural Frame and Pernicana Fault System [ ] Mount Etna, located in eastern Sicily (Italy) along the 7 Ionian coast, is the highest basaltic composite stratovolcano in Europe (approximately 3340 m) and formed in the last 200 ka [e.g., Romano , 1982; Branca et al ., 2008]. It is char- acterized by a structural setting resulting from a complex regional tectonics with a N-S compressive regime and an extensional regime oriented approximately E-W that is ob- servable along the eastern coast of Sicily [ Bousquet and Lanzafame , 2004]. The relationships of these main structures with the tectonic setting, eruptions, and intrusion directions have been widely discussed by Bonaccorso et al . [1996; fl and references therein]. The eastern ank of the volcanic fi edi ce shows a fairly continuous seaward motion, due to the complex interrelationship between tectonics, gravity instability, and magma intrusion [e.g., Borgia et al ., 1992; Bonforte and Puglisi , 2006; Bonaccorso et al ., 2011].

The rst seismic network was installed in the late fi 1970s, when a short-period, telemetered array ( ve to nine stations) was set up permanently by the University of Catania [ Cosentino et al ., 1982; Gresta and PatanÃ¨ , 1987; PatanÃ¨ et al ., 2004]. Successively, starting from 1989, a new permanent network, made up of 13 stations, was run by Istituto Internazionale di Vulcanologia of Catania. In 1994, another permanent network, consisting of 44 stations, was additionally set up on Etna in the framework of the Poseidon Project. The latter two networks were combined in 2001, when they converged into the seismic network fi Â­ of Istituto Nazionale di Geo sica e Vulcanologia Sezione di Catania, which at present has 50 stations. Over the years, updating the instruments and expanding the seismic network have improved the ability to detect earthquakes and par- fi ticularly microseismicity. During the rst decade, due to problems of hypocenter locations arising from the weak fi con guration of the seismic network, instrumental data were also supported by macroseismic data [ Azzaro , 2004; Azzaro ' and D Amico , 2009]. On the contrary, the data collected in the last decade [ Gruppo Analisi Dati Sismici , 2012] are c(""highly reliable due to the expanded instrumental coverage"", ""(Figure 1).

Three sepa- rate networks were installed in the northeastern, western, fl and southern anks (Figure 1). In particular, the northeastern (NE) network consists of 15 benchmarks, extending from an altitude of 2.850 m down to about 1.000 m above sea level (asl), and it was surveyed once a year on average [ Puglisi et al ., 2004].

However, in geometrically redundant networks, as in our case, line lengths can be used to calculate the relative motion of the fi benchmarks, for example, with respect to an arbitrarily xed fi baseline (i.e., by xing two benchmarks of the network). To show the motion of the area comprised in the NE network Â­ during the time interval 1983 1987, we calculated the dis- placement vectors with respect to the line connecting DAG fi and B09 that is assumed as xed baseline. Fixing these two benchmarks, located at the westernmost side of the network fi and whose distance does not vary signi cantly in time, the relative motion toward the east is well traced (Figure 6a). Velocity vectors show similar modules for all benchmarks fl and also highlight a clockwise rotation of this ank along the NE rift-Pernicana system. [ ] The GPS network has been continuously improved since 15 fi its rst installation in 1990 and consists in the merging of several subnetworks lying on different areas of the volcano, often exploiting already existing geodetic points, plus an exter- nal reference network, in order to refer all point coordinates to a frame that may be considered stable with respect to the volcano. fi [ ] From 1993 to 2001, the volcano edi ce underwent 16 fl fl a constant in ation preceding the 2001 and 2002 ank eruptions. The GPS measurements showed lower velocities of the geodetic benchmarks, which, nonetheless, cumulated marked changes (Figure 6b). [ ] The GPS displacements reported in Figure 6c refer 17 Â­ to the 2003 2004 interval analyzed by Bonaccorso et al . [2006], which is recognized as an exceptionally high-rate deformation period of the eastern side of the volcano follow- Â­ fl ing the end of the 2002 2003 ank eruption. The overall Â­ patterns drawn by the two techniques during 1983 1987 Â­ (Figure 6a) and 2003 2004 (Figure 6c), respectively, are very similar with an overall uniform velocity and a clockwise fl rotation of the NE ank. fl [ ] To highlight the seaward movement of the ank 18 over time, the W-E displacement components obtained from GPS are shown in Figure 7 for four benchmarks of the fl eastern ank. From this plot, both the marked eastward dis- placement caused by the October 2002 dike accompanying fl the beginning of the eruption and the following ank sliding continuing with a high rate also in the following years are well evident. Ground Displacement [ ] Both the cumulative seismic strain release (Figure 3a) 19 and the ground deformation (Figures 4 and 5) show clear changes in their trends. To better compare the two data sets, a displacement time series representative of the deformation fl on the NE ank of Etna recorded during the analyzed period is estimated by combining the EDM and GPS measurements, which have been carried out together for quite a long period, from the early 1990s to 2003. Furthermore, two benchmarks (PDN and CIT, Figure 1) were measured with both EDM and GPS techniques. From 1990 to 2002, the two time series coincide well, demonstrating that the distance variations measured by GPS and EDM are comparable and, hence, can be merged to represent the entire period from 1982. In Figure 8a is reported the CIT movement with respect to PDN by the EDM measurements from 1982 to 2001, which c(""ALPARONE ET AL.: LONG-TERM STRAIN OF ETNA UNSTABLE FLANK"", ""East component changes from GPS measurements"", ""Figure 7."", ""versus time for selected benchmarks located in the eastern"", ""fl"", ""ank (see Figure 1 for site positions)."", ""coincides with an east elongation and then the CIT east dis-"", ""placement by GPS from 2002."", ""["", ""] To quantitatively evaluate the changes in the trends"", ""20"", ""of the seismic strain release and ground deformation time"", ""series, we applied the binary frequency shift keying"",

The estimated free knots and linear trends are reported in Figure 8 for the two time series, where it is worth noting that main changes in the linear trends of the two data sets occur almost simultaneously. Differences in time at which the trends change are observed owing to the different temporal resolution of the two data sets (daily for the strain release and almost yearly for the ground deformation). The fi linear trend values change signi cantly over the analyzed period, showing that increase (decrease) in seismicity are associated with acceleration (deceleration) of the eastern fl fi ank. Three distinct phases can be deduced: (1) a rst phase from 1984 to 1986 characterized by high-deformation and intense seismicity; (2) a second phase from 1987 to 2001, fl when the seismicity dropped drastically and the ank slowed down; (3) a third phase from 2002 onward in which a new high-deformation rate accompanied by an increase in the seismic strain release is observed. Stress Changes Modeling [ ] The ground deformation and seismic strain rates 21 fl suggest an interplay between the stretching of the eastern ank and the stress loading along the PFS.

ALPARONE ET AL.: LONG-TERM STRAIN OF ETNA UNSTABLE FLANK Discussion [ ] In the past, the kinematic of the PFS has mainly been 27 investigated by separate studies of seismicity and deformation over the short term, i.e., for periods related to seismic swarms Â­ or astride single eruptions. Recently, a 10 year (2000 2009) fi analysis on the earthquakes along the PFS con rmed that this fault system represents the northern border of the unstable fl eastern volcano ank and revealed predominant normal kine- matic also accompanied by left strike movement [ Alparone et al ., 2013]. The deformation studies on the PFS role fl improved after the 2002 eruption. Both ank dynamics and PFS movements were studied just prior to the 2002 eruption [ Bonforte et al ., 2007c; Currenti et al ., 2010] and in the years fl following this eruption when the eastern ank started to move very rapidly allowing robust modeling of the sliding plane [ Bonaccorso et al ., 2006; Bonforte et al ., 2008]. fi [ ] The present study highlights that a rst phase of high 28 seismic strain started with the seismic swarm of October 1984 and was mainly released until October 1986 (Figure 3). Similarly, the EDM geodetic distance baselines showed marked changes from the end of 1984 (measurement compar- ison between September 1984 and October 1985) to 1986 (Figures 4 and 5). The displacement pattern clearly shows a fl stretching of the eastern ank toward the sea (Figure 7a) that continued after the end of the main seismic release (1986) until fi October 1988 when also a nal seismic activity occurred. During the beginning of this period (phase 1, Figure 8), there were no eruptions and/or evidence of propagating dikes; therefore, we have to exclude that this marked sliding of the fl ank was promoted by an intrusion trigger. [ ] During the second phase, from November 1986 to 29 October 2002, the PFS seismic release attenuated notably (Figure 3). During this interval, also the deformation was less marked, and the NE network revealed a moderate contraction fl Â­ accompanying the de ation associated with the 1992 1993 fl ank eruption and a less marked line extension from 1994 fl to 2001 during the in ation phase (Figures 4, 5, and 6b), fi which characterized the entire edi ce until the 2001 and Â­ fl 2002 2003 ank eruptions [ Bonaccorso and Davis , 2004]. From 1994, only moderate and steady elongations were observed in the nearly W-E oriented baselines (Figure 5), fl which were engendered by the overall in ation and also by fl the slow sliding of the eastern ank [ Currenti et al ., 2010; Bonaccorso et al ., 2011]. However, despite the action of fl the in ating volcanic source, a marked sliding contribution was not observed. The moderate continuous elongations, observed since 1994, were interrupted by the 2001 eruption Â­ and the following 2002 2003 eruption, which coincides with the starting of the third phase. During the onset of the fi fl latter eruption, a rst dike ascended in the southern ank, and a second dike propagated laterally in the northeastern fl ank along the NE rift [ Andronico et al ., 2005], which represents a conjunction between the summit crater and the upper part of the PFS (Figure 1). During the dike intru- fi sions, the volcano edi ce underwent marked deformation [ Aloisi et al ., 2003], and from 27 October, the dike intrusion along the NE sector promoted an intense seaward motion fl of the unstable eastern ank that continued also in the Â­ following years with velocity rates of 7 9 mm/month in the Â­ period 2002 2004 [ Bonaccorso et al ., 2006; Bonforte et al ., 2007a]. In this case, unlike phase 1, the trigger action of 5106 the dike that promoted the marked sliding was clearly Â­ evident. It is important to note that the 2004 2005 and 2006 fl ank eruptions were not accompanied by seismic activity along the PFS, and a very poor rate of seismicity in the entire volcano was recorded. This aspect supports the inter- pretation that for these eruptions, the magma intruded passively along the fractures favored by exceptional extension fl due to the high sliding rate of the eastern ank [ Bonaccorso fi et al ., 2006; Bonforte et al ., 2008]. Signi cant swarms of earthquakes occurred in February and May 2008, resulting in a considerable jump in the cumulative strain release trend (Figure 3). In particular, the May 2008 swarms accom- panied the initial phase of the May 2008 eruption [ Aloisi et al ., 2009]. [ ] The years following the starting of the 2002 eruption, 30 i.e., the third phase, represent a further period of intense fl sliding of the eastern ank and powerful seismic release on the PFS. After the eruption, the strain release attenuated, albeit showing a rate higher than the previous second phase. The trend extended throughout the following years and Â­ received a huge contribution from the seismic swarm on 2 3 April 2010. [ ] In general, the comparison of seismic release and defor- 31 mation patterns highlights that both the earthquake occurrence fl along the PFS and the sliding of the eastern ank have increasing and stable phases occurring in the same periods. This interplay has also been corroborated by numerical com- putations that highlight a good correlation along the PFS between the seismicity pattern and areas of positive stress changes induced by the sliding surface. These aspects sup- port the idea that PFS can be viewed as a marker of the seismic response to accommodate the stress change induced by magmatic intrusion in the northern sector and/or the tectonic loading associated with the sliding of the volcano fl eastern ank. Over long periods, the latter could be the primary mechanism, which regulates the seismic release along the fault. This conclusion is in agreement with the stress redistribution analysis conducted for different volcano fl fl sources (dikes, in ating source, and ank sliding) by Bonaccorso et al . [2013]. However, we should underline fl that the cause triggering the phases of acceleration in ank sliding is not univocal. Indeed, we have evidence that the fl ank sliding can be activated both by its own instability fi and/or by magma intrusion action. In the case of the rst Â­ phase (1984 1987), the sliding was not promoted by erup- fl tions. As a matter of fact, the previous main ank eruption occurred in March 1983 through a radial dike in the south- fl ern ank about 20 months before the October 1984 seis- mic swarms. Moreover, Bonaccorso et al . [2013] showed fl that this kind of intrusion in the southern ank does not fi fi induce signi cant variations in the stress eld along the Â­ PFS. Instead, in the case of the third phase (2002 2010), fl the sharp and marked sliding of the eastern ank started in concomitance with the radial intrusion along the north- fl eastern ank [ Aloisi et al ., 2003; Bonaccorso et al ., 2006] fi during the rst days of the 2002 eruption, showing a fl clear ank response to the intrusive process. Moreover, fl both the intrusions along the northeastern ank, as shown by Bonaccorso et al . [2013], and the traction due to the fl sliding ank, as shown in the present work, markedly pro- mote variation in static stress and consequent earthquakes along the PFS.

5 alparone jgrb50364.pdf,C,Journal of Geophysical Research,"Final Remarks [ ] Over the long term (decades), the deformation and 32 seismic patterns highlighted different behaviors of the unstable fl eastern ank dynamics. These patterns characterized two phases fl of ank acceleration separated by a phase of near stability: Â­ [ ] 1. Phase 1 (1984 1986): the seismicity along the PFS 33 fl began in 1984 followed by the ank sliding that continued until 1988. Before this phase, there was no intrusion in the NE sector that could have triggered the sliding. On the fl contrary, the 1986 intrusion occurred after the ank shifted eastward. Therefore, in this case, the sliding started without the action of an intrusion. Â­ fl [ ] 2. Phase 2 (1987 2001): the eastern ank movement 34 slowed down. No relevant seismicity was recorded during this interval. A slight contraction of the geodetic lines was fl Â­ recorded during the de ation associated with the 1992 1993 eruption, and elongation of the geodetic lines was recorded Â­ fl around the entire volcano during the 1994 2001 overall in a- fl tion preceding the 2001 and 2002 ank eruptions. In this fl case, the in ation source, even if producing a considerable fi fl expansion of the entire edi ce, did not promote an east ank sliding acceleration. [ ] 3. Phase 3 (from 2002 to following years): the seismic- 35 ity along the PFS recommenced strongly in September 2002 fi caused by a rst attempt of magma intrusion in the upper NE fl rift. In October 2002, a huge intrusion along the NE ank fl pushed the eastern ank and promoted a fast and marked sliding. In this case, the relation between cause (intrusion) and effect (sliding) was very clear. [ ] The overall framework highlights that over the long 36 term, the stress change induced by the sliding of the volcano fl eastern ank is the primary mechanism to regulate the seis- fi mic release along the PFS. In the rst phase, the sliding fl would seem to be due to the self-instability of the ank that occurred without a clear contribution from volcanic sources. fl However, the ank sliding can be affected by the action fl induced by magmatic sources with a slight in uence of a fl deep in ation source (phase 2), without associated seismic- ity, and a predominant effect of intrusions along the NE rift (phase 3).

Introduction Understanding the conditions under which an earthquake rupture may jump--or not--from one fault The copyright line for this article was segment to another in complex fault systems is critical to determine why and how an initial rupture changed on 30 MAR 2015 after original develops--or not--into a large to very large event [ Harris et al. , 1991]. Two recent examples in transpres- online publication. sional fault systems illustrate rupture initiation on a small secondary thrust segment that jumped onto a longer strike-slip fault, leading to large magnitude events. A classic case is the 2002 M 7.9 Denali earthquake, which initiated on the 48 km long Susitna Glacier blind thrust fault, jumped to the Denali strike-slip fault to rupture a 220 km long segment, and finally propagated to the Totschunda strike-slip fault for another 70 km [ Ratchkovski et al. , 2004; HreinsdÃ³ttir et al. , 2006; Eberhart-Phillips et al. , 2003]. Similarly, the 2010 M 7.1 Darfield, New Zealand, earthquake initiated on the Charing Cross thrust fault, transferred to a left-lateral link- ing fault, and finally propagated to the main right-lateral Greendale fault [ Gledhill et al. , 2011; Beavan et al. , 2012]. In contrast, there are cases where rupture initiation on a thrust fault did not propagate to a major, closely spaced, strike-slip fault. The classic example is the 1989 M 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake [ Dietz and Ellsworth , 1990; Oppenheimer , 1990; Beroza , 1991; Kilb et al. , 1997] which ruptured a steeply dipping blind reverse fault abutting against the major strike-slip San Andreas fault but did not propagate onto that fault. Similar to the Loma Prieta earthquake, the 2010 M 7.0 Haiti earthquake ruptured two segments of the secondary reverse LÃ©ogÃ¢ne Fault but did not transfer to the nearby Enriquillo Plantain Garden Fault (EPGF), the major plate boundary fault cutting through southern Haiti (Figure 1) [ Calais et al. , 2010]. Had such a jump occurred, this already very destructive earthquake would have likely been an even more devastating one. Aftershock relocations delineate the LÃ©ogÃ¢ne rupture on two north dipping segments with slightly different azimuths, dip angles, and overall sense of slip [ Douilly et al. , 2013]. Finite fault inversions from teleseismic data show that rupture propagated from the eastern segment (primarily thrust) to the western segment (primarily strike slip) within only a few kilometers of the Enriquillo fault [ Mercier de LÃ©pinay et al. , 2011; Meng et al. , 2012], yet geodetic and geological observations show that no slip was triggered on that major fault. Coseismic stress changes were sufficient to induce aftershocks on the nearby offshore Trois Baies reverse fault, though again no slip was detected on that fault [ Symithe et al. , 2013].

The white arrows are the motions of the different plates with respect to the Caribbean plate. Here we investigate the rupture process of the Haiti earthquake using dynamic simulations in order to understand why rupture propagated across the two LÃ©ogÃ¢ne subsegments but not to other nearby faults, in a manner similar to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The conditions under which slip on a secondary &gt; thrust may propagate to a major plate boundary fault capable of M 8 events in transpressional contexts are important to understand the seismogenic potential of such systems. We also seek to determine whether a simple rupture geometry with a single fault made of two subsegments [e.g., Calais et al. , 2010] is sufficient to explain the coseismic observations or whether a more complex geometry with multiple faults [e.g., Hayes et al. , 2010] is required. To do so we use a finite element model capable of simulating the dynamics of slip propagation based on fault geometry, fault frictional parameters, and regional stress field. Our objective is to find the set of model parameters that best explains the observed earthquake sequence in terms of geodetically and seismically inferred slip, aftershock triggering, and observed surface deformation."
70 douilly jgrb51006.pdf,M,Journal of Geophysical Research,"2.1. Tectonic Background: The 2010 Haiti Earthquake The 12 January 2010 M 7.0 Haiti earthquake struck a segment inboard of the Caribbean-North America w plate boundary that had not ruptured in a significant event since a series of three events in 1701, 1751, 1770, which also caused severe damage in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital city [ McCann , 2006]. Although the exact locus and magnitude of these events remains poorly constrained, they are thought to have ruptured segments of the Enriquillo Plantain Garden Fault (EPGF) running through the southern peninsula of Haiti [ Bakun et al. , 2012]. The EPGF (Figure 1) is one of the three major faults accommodating the 19 mm/yr, east-northeastward motion of the Caribbean plate with respect to North America [ DeMets et al. , 2000]. Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements show that this motion is partitioned in Hispaniola between plate boundary-parallel slip on the Septentrional fault and EPGF in the overriding plate, and thrust motion at the plate interface along the north Hispaniola fault zone [ Calais et al. , 2002; Mann et al. , 2002]. GPS Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011595 measurements in the northeastern Caribbean and kinematic block models show that the EPGF currently accommodates 6Â­7 mm/yr of left-lateral strike-slip motion [ Manaker et al. , 2008; Calais et al. , 2010] with a strike-normal shortening component that may be as large as 5 mm/yr [ Benford et al. , 2012]. The source mechanism of the 2010 Haiti earthquake shows that the event generated a combination of strike 19 slip (mostly) and reverse slip with a seismic moment of 4.4 to 4.9 Ã— 10 N m corresponding to M 7.0Â­7.1 w [ Nettles and HjÃ¶rleifsdÃ³ttir , 2010; Mercier de LÃ©pinay et al. , 2011]. Interestingly, the event did not rupture the surface but caused up to 0.6 m of regional uplift [ Hayes et al. , 2010]. Finite fault inversions of geodetic (GPS and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)), geological (coastal uplift), and teleseismic data show that the earthquake did not rupture the EPGF but an unmapped fault--the LÃ©ogÃ¢ne fault--dipping steeply to the north and oblique to the vertical to south dipping EPGF [ Calais et al. , 2010; Hayes et al. , 2010; Mercier de LÃ©pinay et al. , 2011; Meng et al. , 2012]. Finite fault inversions show that the earthquake initiated at the eastern end of the rupture and propagated westward with two patches of high slip, an eastern one with mainly reverse dip-slip motion and a western one mainly strike slip. Overall, two thirds of the seismic moment is released by strike-slip motion and one third by dip-slip motion. A precise relocation of aftershocks recorded by a temporary onshore/offshore seismic deployment during the 5 months following the event has been able to image the LÃ©ogÃ¢ne rupture in some detail [ Douilly et al. , 2013], showing that it consists of two segments with slightly distinct azimuth and dip angles (Figure 1). Aftershock focal mechanisms show mostly reverse fault motion on the eastern segment and strike slip on the western one, consistent with finite fault inversions. These two segments correspond to the two slip patches imaged by finite fault inversion [ Symithe et al. , 2013]. This result is corroborated by a backprojection study [ Meng et al. , 2012] that imaged high-frequency source radiation and found westward rupture with two subevents 35 km apart, the approximate distance between the centers of the two slip patches determined from finite fault inversions. Meng et al. [2012] also perform a finite fault inversion using geodetic, geological, and teleseismic data and determine a 15 s duration source time function with two subevents (corresponding to slip on the two rupture patches mentioned above), the first impulsive one, followed by a lower moment release subevent5slater. Symithe et al. [2013] show that static coseismic Coulomb stress changes increase significantly in the top part of the Enriquillo fault and to the west and east of the rupture. They also argue that the increase in Coulomb stress on the Trois Baies fault (TBF) explains the aftershocks triggered on that fault. In the following, we use the fault geometry (Figure 1) determined in the precise aftershock relocation study of Douilly et al. [2013] to build and run forward models of dynamic rupture propagation and investigate the conditions under which rupture jumps, or not, to adjacent segments. 3.1. Fault Model and Numerical Method We aim to simulate the rupture propagation for the 2010 Haiti earthquake and understand the conditions that could lead the rupture to propagate on the LÃ©ogÃ¢ne fault segments and not transfer to the other neighboring faults. We use Cubit (available from http://cubit.sandia.gov) to generate a finite element model that is 176 km long, 130 km wide, and 60 km deep, centered around the city of LÃ©ogÃ¢ne (Figure 2). We approximated the fault geometry with four planar segments representing the EPGF, the East and West LÃ©ogÃ¢ne faults, and the Troie Baie fault. The EPGF fault trace is well expressed in the morphology [ Mann  et al. , 1995] in the epicentral region, where Prentice et al. [2010] report field evidence of a 65 dip to the south, consistent with the interpretation of aftershock relocations by Douilly et al. [2013]. We use the strike and dip of the East and West LÃ©ogÃ¢ne fault segments and Trois Baies fault derived from the spatial distribu- tion and focal mechanism of the aftershocks of the January 2010 earthquake [ Douilly et al. , 2013]. As we ran our forward models, we observed that the geodetic data was fit significantly better with a western LÃ©ogÃ¢ne segment located 2 km to the north compared to the one in Symithe et al. [2013], still consistent with the scatter in aftershock hypocenters. We discretized the model space using tetrahedral elements of 100 m size in the vicinity of the rupture that . n increase in size at a geometric rate of 1 03 toward the outer regions of the mesh, where n is an integer which depends on the distance from a reference point on the eastern LÃ©ogÃ¢ne segment to any point inside the medium. The final model has 4.87 millions of tetrahedral elements in total. c(""Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth"", ""10.1002/2014JB011595"", ""Figure 2."", ""(a) Three-dimensional view of the fault geometry inside the domain.

We Radius of nucleation 2500 (m) have no direct estimate of principal Slip weakening distance ( D ) 0.3 (m) stresses in southern Haiti but know that c the tectonic regime combines strike Time step 0.005 (s) slip and thrust faulting. We therefore consider that the maximum principal stress direction is horizontal. We used a trial-and-error approach by   varying the orientation of the maximum stress direction (N90 WtoN90 E) to find the optimum direction and amplitude of the stress axes consistent with the known slip direction of each fault segment, which was estimated from the focal mechanisms study of Douilly et al. [2013], supposing that a regional stress field is globally unchanged before and after the 2010 earthquake. Doing so, we related the principal strain com- ponents using the shape factor R [ Angelier , 1990; Aagaard et al. , 2004] to the principal stress (without the isotropic lithostatic component):   - 1 2  4  4 - - R = where = 6 e and = 1 e (1a)   1 2 - 1 3            + 2 1 1           = + 2 (1b)  2     2             + 2 3 3     where is the principal strain, is the principal stress, and and are the LamÃ© parameters. In the following, we test two cases of regional tectonic stress: one where stress is independent of equations (1a) and (1b) with uniform shear and normal stress applied to all the faults (scenarios O1 and O2), the other where principal stresses obey equations (1a) and (1b) with three subcases: R = 0.4 (scenario A), R = 0.6 (scenario B), and R = 0.8 (scenario C). Slip vectors are usually colinear with the direction of the applied shear stresses on each fault [ Angelier , 1979; Gephart and Forsyth , 1984]. Therefore, we can estimate the direction (azimuth) of the maximum principal stress so that the loading shear traction is consistent with the slip direction observed on the LÃ©ogÃ¢ne segments during the 2010 Haiti earthquake. We find that (1) the stress orientation does not change significantly among scenarios when we vary the tectonic regime (Table 3), and (2) a maximum principal  stress direction of N60 Â± 10 E agrees well with the observed motion on the faults, as shown in Figures 3aÂ­3c  for scenario B. Therefore, we consider in the following two values for the principal stress orientation (N50 E  and N60 E). Those directions of the maximum principal stress are consistent with the expected stress regime of a left-lateral transpressional context with generally E-W striking faults, as indicated by geodetic studies [ Calais et al. , 2010; Benford et al. , 2012].   The estimated N50 E and N60 E maximum principal stress direction, however, do not satisfy observations for the Trois Baies fault (Figures 1 and 3d). We must therefore rotate the stress tensor on that fault by  N30 5 E in order to match the observed reverse shear tractions. This is corroborated by an inversion of the Â± focal mechanisms of aftershocks on the Troies Baie fault for a deviatoric stress tensor using the technique  of Hardebeck and Michael [2006], which gives a horizontal maximum principal stress with a 30 azimuth. A similar calculation for the focal mechanisms on the eastern (respectively western) segment of the LÃ©ogÃ¢ne    fault indicates an horizontal maximum principal stress of 83 (respectively 75 ) azimuth.

The dashed red lines indicate the azimuth (50 and 60 ) deduced for our simulation, and the grey regions indicate the observation range.  azimuth is slightly greater than the 50Â­60 of our estimation, this might confirm the hypothesis of the pos- sible counterclockwise rotation of the principal stress across this region. We acknowledge that the ambient stresses calculated here could be biased because aftershocks result from a stress field modified by the main shock. However, the fact that the strain rate field derived from interseismic geodetic measurements in Haiti is consistent with the 2010 earthquake coseismic source [ Calais et al. , 2010] suggests that the bias is small. Additional work is needed to better determine the regional background stress independently from the 2010 earthquake aftershock sequence. After estimating the principal stress, we rotated it from the principal stress coordinate system to the  east-north-up coordinate system ( ) and superimposed the depth-dependent lithostatic overburden d  pressure ( gh ), which prevents faults from opening. The total stress is therefore given by the following:    gh 00      = + 0 gh 0 (2) d      00 gh  where is medium density, g is gravitational acceleration, and h is depth. The resulting stress tensor is then used to calculate the initial normal and shear tractions on each fault in the model. The initial loading tractions for each fault are summarized in Table 3. 3.3. Rupture Criterion and Friction Law We consider a slip weakening friction law [ Ida , 1972; Andrews , 1976] with Coulomb rupture criterion. The   resistance of the interface is given by a product of the normal stress and a friction coefficient : n f {  D    1 if D D +( - )( - ) dynamic static dynamic c  D = (3) c f  &gt; if D D dynamic c   where D is slip, D is the slip weakening distance, and / are the dynamic/static friction coeffi- c dynamic static cients. We consider a depth-dependent normal traction and assume that friction coefficients vary inversely with depth in order to assure a constant stress drop throughout each fault (Figure 4 [ Aagaard et al. , 2001]), namely  2 b    - 1 and 10 (4) = = static  dynamic static n c(""Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth"", ""10.1002/2014JB011595"", ""Normal traction"", ""Static friction"", ""Dynamic friction"", ""Normal traction"", ""Static friction"", ""Dynamic friction"", ""Normal traction"", ""Static friction"", ""Dynamic friction"", ""Normal traction"", ""Static friction"", ""Dynamic friction"", ""Figure 4."", ""Normal traction (black), static (red), and dynamic (blue) coefficients of friction on each fault for scenario B."", ""where"", """", ""is the shear velocity and"", ""b"", ""is a constant.

Snapshot of rupture propagation on the fault for scenario C. For all three scenarios, the rupture on the eastern LÃ©ogÃ¢ne is transferred on the western segment at about 3.5 s after nucleation. of the faults combined with the geometry of the fault system and potentially the friction on those two faults. We also ran a simulation shifting the nucleation zone to the bottom east corner of the eastern LÃ©ogÃ¢ne segment (scenario O2), where rupture initiation is proposed by Mercier de LÃ©pinay et al. [2011]. As the rupture front on the eastern LÃ©ogÃ¢ne segment is unilateral over a longer distance than in scenario O1, the rupture should accumulate more energy and transfer to neighboring segments more easily. Results are, however, similar to scenario O1 (Figure 8, bottom), with increased slip at the initial crack location because of the larger stress drop. Rupture transfers to the western LÃ©ogÃ¢ne segment after 4.5 s but not to the Enriquillo or Trois Baies faults. As there is no seismological observation in the near field during the 2010 Haiti earthquake and we can only compare our simulation results with geodetic data of finite ground displacement, we cannot distinguish this difference in timing between scenario O1 and scenario O2 from the data. In the following, we therefore set rupture initiation to the center of the eastern LÃ©ogÃ¢ne segment as in scenario O1. 4.2. Variable Stress Orientations We now show simulation results that account for the known tectonic setting, as defined in the previous section (Figures 3 and 4 and Table 3), initiating nucleation at the same location as scenario O1 above. In all three scenarios (A, B, or C) the rupture breaks the whole eastern LÃ©ogÃ¢ne segment and triggers the western segment after 3.5 s, but not the Enriquillo or Trois Baies faults (Figure 9). As the rupture is propagating on the eastern LÃ©ogÃ¢ne fault, the stress condition on the Enriquillo fault is changing (Figure 10). At4stwo distinct patches of increase and decrease in shear stress develop on the Enriquillo fault. They continue to grow while the rupture is propagating on the western LÃ©ogÃ¢ne fault. At the end, the simulation shows a significant increase in shear stress (Figure 10) at the top part of the Enriquillo fault (7 MPa) and to the west of the rupture (4 MPa). On the Trois Baies fault, shear stress increase is signifi- cant near its intersection with the Enriquillo fault and the western LÃ©ogÃ¢ne fault, while the amplitude of the c(""Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth"", ""10.1002/2014JB011595"", ""t=0.5 s"", ""t=2 s"", ""t=3 s"", ""t=5 s"", ""t=12 s"", ""t=4 s"", ""t=6 s"", ""t=15 s"", ""Figure 10."", ""Snapshots of the shear stress change on the Enriquillo and Trois Baies faults for the scenario B.

Also, scenarios A and B are more impulsive than scenario C at the start. The reason for that is although the shear stress magnitudes for all three scenarios are of the same order, the updip component of the shear stress on the eastern LÃ©ogÃ¢ne is higher for scenarios A and B compare to scenario C. All three scenarios show strike-slip motion with some component of reverse dip-slip motion on the western part of the LÃ©ogÃ¢ne fault rather than purely strike-slip motion as reported in previous studies [ Calais et al. , 2010; Hayes et al. , 2010; Symithe et al. , 2013]. The reason for this difference is due to the trade-off in the chosen azimuth of the maximum principal stress (Figure 3). A smaller  value (less than 50 ) would generate more strike-slip motion on the western segment but less dip-slip motion on the eastern segment of the LÃ©ogÃ¢ne fault. On the other hand, a larger azimuth  (more than 50 ) would generate less strike-slip motion on the western seg- ment but more dip-slip motion on the eastern segment of the LÃ©ogÃ¢ne fault. 4.3. Comparison With Observed Surface Deformation Although the simulations described above produce a rupture propagat- Figure 11.

Scenario A scenario we compare the final surface displays a faster rupture propagation, and slower propagation is shown in scenario B. displacements from the simulations to the coseismic observations from GPS, InSAR, and coastal uplifts from coral microatolls (Figure 13). Overall, the fit is remarkably good for all three scenarios, considering that these are forward models based on fairly simple mechanical assumptions. Scenario C has the smallest weighted RMS misfit of the three and matches the geodetic observations as well Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 10.1002/2014JB011595 as the published kinematic finite source Mw=7.1 scenario A inversions [ Calais et al. , 2010; Hayes et al. , 2010; Meng et al. , 2012; Symithe et al. , 2013]. In the process of comparing simulation outputs to InSAR displacements, we also tested the exact same LÃ©ogÃ¢ne fault geometry as used by Symithe et al. [2013] in their finite fault inversion of geodetic data. As also noted in their paper, this results in a systematic offset of 1.5Â­3 km between the observed and simulated interferograms. Symithe et al. [2013] propose that this offset Mw=7.1 scenario B results from the 1-D seismic velocity model used by Douilly et al. [2013] in their after- shock relocations. These authors allow for the possibility of a bias up to 1Â­2 km southward based on systematic traveltime residuals for a few stations in the south- ern part of the southern peninsula. The geometry chosen here, where the LÃ©ogÃ¢ne fault is located 2 km to the north compared to Symithe et al. [2013] and scenario C is assumed, shows a very good agreement Mw=7.1 with the vertical coseismic motion from scenario C InSAR (Figure 14), with a weighted RMS misfit to 0.035 m. We therefore suggest that further work on this earthquake assumes the geometry used in this study best fit dynamic model. 5.1. Implications for Fault Interactions The dynamic simulations described above show that the rupture of the 2010 Haiti Figure 12. Moment rate function with respect to time for all three earthquake can be reproduced successfully scenarios. All three scenarios have a moment magnitude of 7.1. The using a simple geometry (LÃ©ogÃ¢ne divided moment rate function for each scenario indicates two prominent into two segments) and simple assumptions peak at about 8 s apart which is consistent with the source time function from Meng et al. [2012]. about the model parameters. A key feature of these successful simulations is the fact that the Enriquillo and Trois Baies faults are not triggered by the earthquake (for both the homogeneous and heterogeneous stress field cases), in spite of significant dynamic stress changes imparted by the rupture as shown in Figure 15. Figure 15 shows the evolution of slip, slip rate, and shear stress magnitude with time on specific point on each fault as shown in Figure 2. By initiating the rupture on the eastern LÃ©ogÃ¢ne segment and due to the chosen frictional parameters and slip weakening distance, the shear stress on the point on that segment   starts increasing at 2.8 s and slip begins at 3 s. Because of the small distance to failure value ( - ) com- f i   pared to the dynamic stress drop ( ) and since we initiate the rupture on this fault, the rupture is able - i s to propagate along the entire segment. If we increase the slip weakening distance, then the rupture slows down and eventually stops within the eastern LÃ©ogÃ¢ne segment without impacting other model faults. At about 3.5 s, the rupture reaches the intersection between the two segments and at 8.5 s shear stress starts increasing on the point on the western segment. Failure stress on that segment is higher than on the eastern one, but the shear stress imparted by the rupture to the east eventually overcomes the failure stress, triggering slip at about 10 s. The reason for this significant increase in shear stress at the intersection between the two segments is the favorable orientation of the western segment with respect to the stress c(""Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth"", ""10.1002/2014JB011595"", ""Figure 13."", ""(left column) The observed (GPS) and calculated horizontal displacement for each scenario.

In our simulations, the rupture propagates onto all the model seg- ments if we suppose very weak faults  ( = 0.17). In other words, the sim- static ulation results support the notion that the fault strength should not be that low, which is consistent with the other dynamic rupture simulations of similar segmentation situations [ Harris et al. , 2002]. The rupture transfer is also controlled by the geometrical irreg- ularities between the segments such as gap distance [e.g., Harris et al. , 1991]. Kase [2010] showed that the rupture transfer becomes more difficult from the second to third segment than the first to the second, as the propagating rupture cannot keep sufficient energy to rup- ture distant fault segment. With a similar analogy, if the medium between the segments behaves anelastically for a large deformation [ Geist and Andrews , 2000], it may absorb a significant amount of rupture energy, which in turn hinders rupture transfer to neighboring segments. All these factors act to prevent rupture transfer from the western LÃ©ogÃ¢ne segment to the other fault segments and thus do not change our general conclusion. Another important aspect of our simulations is the requirement to parameterize the eastern LÃ©ogÃ¢ne segment as weaker than the neigh- boring segments in order to insure westward rupture propagation even- though other studies stated that the fault strength is also depending on the maturity of the fault [ Manighetti et al. , 2007].

[2011], however, their estimates for LaC and FUC are slightly greater ( 0.6 g).  For stations farther away from the rupture area, we find a PGA of (  0.15 g) for PRY and PGv and less than 0.1 g for TPM which are still significantly lower than the other studies. In Port-au-Prince, our estimate of  0.1 g is close to that of Hough et al. [2012], who used a rigid body displacement method to estimate a PGA of  0.2 g, significantly lower than those reported by Mavroeidis and Scotti [2013], Olson et al. [2011], and the USGS shake map, where PGA is 0.3 g. The reason for this discrepancy is because PGA is usually controlled  by high frequencies which our models could not generate since the highest frequency of the mesh is 2.3 Hz, and we had to filter the ground acceleration in order to reduce the digital noises. Also, these generated synthetics do not take into account any site effects, which have been shown to be important in Port-au-Prince in particular [ Hough et al. , 2010, 2011], but are not considered in our modeling. For better understanding the ground motions and the disaster in the Port-au-Prince area, it will be necessary to combine the reliable input ground motions estimated from the deterministic simulations of this study and the site amplification effect inferred in the ongoing microzonation study [ Gilles et al. , 2013]."

Conclusions The dynamic rupture simulations of the 2010, M 7.0, Haiti earthquake described here show that a simple w two-segment, planar fault geometry derived from the precise aftershock relocation study of Douilly et al. [2013], together with the appropriate regional stress and friction model, can successfully replicate a rupture propagating from east to west and a finite ground displacement consistent with geodetic observations. PGA estimates in the near- and far-field area are lower than other studies, but this is probably because local site conditions were not included in our larger-scale models. This physically sound model calculated here agrees well with finite fault inversions of geodetic and seismo- logical observations. The two fault patches inferred in most finite fault inversions can be explained by the successive rupture of two fault segments oriented favorably with respect to the rupture propagation in the presence of appropriate tectonic stresses, friction coefficients, and slip weakening distance to those faults. As inferred from finite fault inversions, rupture does not propagate to the neighboring Enriquillo or Trois Baies faults because, given their geometry and orientation (strike and dip) with respect to the rupture Acknowledgments This research is supported by a propagation on the LÃ©ogÃ¢ne fault, shear stress on those two faults did not reach failure. However, COCONet Graduate Fellowship from simulations indicate a significant static stress increase on the top and to the west of the Enriquillo fault UNAVCO to RD and National Science and also on the Trois Baies fault near its intersection to the Enriquillo and the western LÃ©ogÃ¢ne segment, Foundation awards EAR-0409487, EAR-RAPID-1024990, and EAR-1045809 consistent with previous results from finite fault inversions [ Symithe et al. , 2013].
