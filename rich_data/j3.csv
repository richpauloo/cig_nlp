Dynamic topography and geoid anomalies are computed using a formulation that includes the self-gravitation and employs consistent boundary flux tech- niques ( Leng and Zhong, 2008 ). Dynamic topography includes contributions only from mantle dynamics with no contribution from the crust buoyancy ( Hager and Richards, 1989 ).
