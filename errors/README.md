The scripts and files herein will reproduce errors encountered by `readPDFXML()` and `getSectionText()` to aid the development of their respective packages.  

# Getting Started

2. Open and run `01_reproduce_errors.R` in `readPDFXML_errors` and `getSectionText_errors`, to reproduce errors associated with each function.  
3. Within `01_reproduce_errors.R`, you will need to change local path variables to point to various folders.
